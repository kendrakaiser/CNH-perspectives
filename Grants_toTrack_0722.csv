BE-CNH,ES,grant.3029244,216560,21,10,subset,3,No,BE/CNH: Agrarian Landscapes in Transition: A Cross-Scale Approach,BE/CNH: Agrarian Landscapes in Transition: A Cross-Scale Approach,"Agrarian transformations represent the most pervasive alteration of the Earth's terrestrial environment during the past 10,000 years. Many current conceptualizations of these transformations assume a simple linear model, however, positing that change is driven by present-day economic, demographic, and technological conditions. This interdisciplinary research project will trace the effects of the introduction, spread, and abandonment of agriculture at six sites in the U.S., with comparisons also made with comparable sites in Mexico and France. The U.S. sites are members of the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network. This project incorporates an integrated, long-term cycle that includes land-use change affecting landscapes, altered landscapes affecting ecological processes, and both influencing the ways in which humans monitor and respond to their surroundings, which engender further cycles of change. The central objective of this research is to identify and quantify the ways in which these integrated cycles differ across cultures, across biogeographic regions, and across time. A suite of quantitative and narrative analyses will be used to identify the prime determinants of long-term dynamics, present-day patterns, and reservoirs of ecological and social resilience in these systems. Analytical approaches will include structural-equation modeling, analysis of spatial and causal effects, and cross-site comparisons of case studies. As a practical test of the project's results, approaches and insights that includes an emphasis on eco-regional planning and scenario building will be examined in the context of conservation planning at The Nature Conservancy (TNC). This project will contribute to both science and society in many ways. It will demonstrate the importance of social science information and approaches in ecosystem investigations, expanding the results of the LTER network and breaching the divide between social and natural science. The data protocols developed will also benefit other communities of social and natural scientists through the involvement of the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), a major national repository of social science data. This project will help to develop general theories on how socio-ecological legacies, as well as lags in the recognition of and response to change, vary across space and time. Through detailed case histories and quantitative analyses, the project expects to provide convincing evidence that humans act not only to disturb ecosystems but also monitor ecosystem values and respond to maintain stability and minimize crises. Project results will provide information of direct use to policy makers, TNC, and land managers by using an approach that explicitly relates socio-ecological processes to varying levels of political organization. The cross-scale data collection and analyses are expected to demonstrate that some patterns of human-ecological interactions are surprisingly long term, vary across space and time, and are non-linear. The project's most significant long-term contribution may prove to be through education; as this project will train new interdisciplinary scientists at all levels of the educational spectrum, inform public officials, and contribute to more effective land-management practices. This project is an award resulting from the FY 2002 special competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems.","Agrarian transformations represent the most pervasive alteration of the Earth's terrestrial environment during the past 10,000 years.

BE-CNH,,grant.3057645,508091,4,4,full match,7,No,BE/CNH: Biocomplexity of Integrated Perennial-Annual Agroecosystems,BE/CNH: Biocomplexity of Integrated Perennial-Annual Agroecosystems,"Agroecosystems are among the most complex and intricately coupled sets of human and natural systems on Earth. On a global scale, the consequence of intensive food production is closely linked to the health and stability of both biophysical and human systems. In the Midwestern U.S., the almost-complete replacement of perennial-dominated vegetation by annual crops has significantly impacted environmental services that maintain function and stability of both the human and biophysical systems. The possibility that these trends can be reversed through the re-introduction of perennial vegetation into agricultural landscapes is underscored by two parallel processes: (1) the increasing emphasis of agricultural policies on promoting conservation practices that incorporate perennial plants, and (2) increasing evidence from field and modeling studies suggesting that increasing perennial cover may significantly enhance both ecological and socioeconomic benefits. Fundamental scientific knowledge is sorely lacking, however, with respect to the complex causes and feedbacks within the human and biophysical systems that will ultimately determine the degree and direction of these changes in perennial-annual systems. This project will integrate a watershed-scale field experiment with modeling simulations to assess coupled ecological and socioeconomic dynamics and trade-offs associated with integrating perennial vegetation in agroecosystems dominated by annual crops in the Midwest. The project will be conducted at the Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge in the Walnut Creek watershed in central Iowa, where approximately one-third of the watershed has been converted to native prairie vegetation, producing a mosaic landscape of agricultural lands and native prairie vegetation that provides an ideal context for this research. The core hypothesis for this research is that strategic locations, amounts, and types of perennial plant cover within agriculturally-dominated landscapes will have a disproportionate effect on the functioning of the biophysical (i.e., water quality and flow, biodiversity) and socioeconomic (i.e., quality of life, economic and social stability) systems. The main objective of this project is to develop an environmental-efficiency index derived from baseline economic and biophysical data that will enable assessment of the extent to which different landscape designs having contrasting annual-perennial plant configurations optimize ecosystem functioning and socioeconomic benefits. This project will include parameterizing, validating, and explicitly linking biophysical and economic models that will be used to assess the environmental benefits and economic costs of various perennial-annual watershed scenarios. This project will have significant impacts on science and society by developing novel approaches to assessing biocomplexity in agricultural landscapes and by providing knowledge that will contribute to policies aimed at effecting positive environmental and socioeconomic change. The project will result in a prototypic decision-making tool that can be applied by a range of governmental agencies and civil society organizations to guide management and policy decisions, thereby offering a scientific basis for assessing trade-offs of alternative intensively managed landscapes. It will establish a scientific understanding of the full societal costs and benefits of integrating perennial vegetation into annually dominated agricultural systems and of the complex dynamics currently influencing adoption and payments of conservation practices that is needed for more effective policy formulation. The project will enhance knowledge of biocomplexity of intensively managed systems and alternative watershed design options within society as a whole by providing educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students as well as through public education and outreach activities conducted through the refuge's learning center that will target a wide range of stakeholders (e.g., policy makers, school children, farmers, etc.). The results and approach developed through this project will have broad applications to assessing trade-offs of alternative intensively managed landscapes and guiding management and policy decisions in other regions in the U.S. and abroad.

Livestock and a species-rich assemblage of large mammalian herbivores, the most abundant of which migrate over a 12,000 square-km area each year, consume a high fraction of primary plant production. These herbivores sustain human populations and a rich assemblage of avian and mammalian carnivores. Moreover, humans, wild animals, and livestock are all vulnerable to a wide variety of infectious diseases. Broad-scale heterogeneity in land use is superimposed on this dynamic landscape. The Serengeti National Park is a classic example of a protected area and ecotourism destination, while the adjacent Ngorongoro Conservation Area permits Maasai pastoralism, game reserves, (Maswa and Ikorongo) permit-controlled off-take of trophy species, and game-controlled areas (Grumeti) that permit all human activity except agriculture. The linkages between human and natural components of the Serengeti are so pervasive that human decision making may be the critical process governing the fate of the entire ecosystem. Pressure is mounting as human and animal populations converge on the western border of Serengeti National Park (SNP) and Mara Reserve. To study the coupling of natural ecosystem functioning and human decision making in the greater Serengeti, this interdisciplinary research project will use four modeling approaches: (1) Process-rich, spatially explicit ecosystem simulation models will be developed to predict changes in plant and animal communities as well as human use of landscapes at different scales. (2) Agent-based models will incorporate individual decision-making rules in a spatially explicit environment. (3) Analytical models of community modules will explore interactions among five to ten key species. (4) Macro-ecological models will describe system patterns and processes as functions of major resource inputs, such as rainfall and soil nutrients. These models will explore emergent dynamics of the Serengeti at various organizational scales. A large amount of Serengeti field data will be analyzed to parameterize the models and to assess their ability to explain past dynamics and current ecosystem trends. In addition, crucial new data on human activities and choices will be collected to understand the coupling of system dynamics between natural and human-dominated components. This blend of different modeling approaches and data syntheses will permit a unique integration of ecological and social sciences. The concept of ecosystem resilience/resistance will be directly related to the vulnerability of human societies. The theory of complex systems proposes that emergent properties can arise from relatively simple underlying mechanisms propagated in space and time. The vulnerability of humans and sustainability of biodiversity in the Serengeti may be driven by a few critical constraints that operate independently of individual components. These constraints arise from fundamental laws/principles in psychology, biology, chemistry, and physics that constrain key biological processes and human decisions. Alternatively, complex systems may be sensitive to small differences in initial conditions and show a tendency to switch between alternative states. This sensitivity suggests that biodiversity and human welfare may be highly contingent on details such as individual behavior, the identity of the species participating, and the precise spatial arrangement of interactions among humans, plants, animals, and diseases. The Serengeti provides a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis, because its component parts are so conspicuous and its dynamical patterns have been measured for 40 years. Finally, emergent system properties may be contingent on just a few critical components, which would imply that the Serengeti can be understood from networks of interaction among a few key species of plants/animals and humans. In addition to providing fundamental new knowledge, the project will provide insights and information of immediate value of managers and decision makers in the study region and many other locales. It also will provide valuable research and training opportunities for students and post-doctoral scholars, and it will facilitate international collaborations between U.S. and African scientists.

Hunting practices in particular among many indigenous groups are probably strongly regulated by internal controls, based on a combination of spiritual beliefs (cosmology), social rituals, and natural history knowledge. Despite the evidence for the key role of cosmology in regulating resource use, most work on game overexploitation and the abandonment of traditional hunting practices by indigenous peoples, particularly in the Neotropics of Central America and northern South America, has focused on the effects of market integration and ignored spiritual and other cultural practices. This research project will test the fundamental hypothesis that retention of traditional practices and cosmology by indigenous societies buffers them against the process of integration into the national society, thereby preventing biodiversity and ecosystem degradation by the indigenous societies themselves. This hypothesis will be evaluated by quantifying resource-use practices and biodiversity status among communities of one ethnic group that differ in their degree of retention of traditional cosmology and practices. The project will be based in the 1.7 million-hectare Raposa Indigenous Area in the northern Brazilian Amazon. The dynamics of hunting by the Macuxi people of this region offer an excellent system for bridging theory and practice in the study of complexity. Hunting practices and degree of integration to Brazilian society vary among 206 villages distributed across the heterogeneous landscape in Raposa. A mechanistic model of animal population dynamics and human hunting practices will be developed and tested using quantitative and qualitative approaches. Socioeconomic data, wildlife data, and remotely sensed data will be collected, integrated, and analyzed within a geographic information system. In addition to a better understanding of human-biodiversity linkages in indigenous areas, outcomes of this project will include (1) educational materials for the Macuxi and the institutions that work with them, (2) a distance-linked graduate seminar in which students collaborate across departments, campuses and disciplines, (3) broadening of the participation of women and minority students in science, and (4) enhancement of the infrastructure for science by linking institutions with different areas of specialty into a teaching and research network that will benefit students who would normally have access only to their own institution. This project will contribute to the development of effective development policies and biodiversity conservation and will help provide theoretical background for coupled human-natural systems in the subsistence or semi-subsistence societies that characterize much of tropics. Research results will be relevant to discussions on the role of overkill by low technology hunters in Pleistocene extinctions and the synergistic effects of environmental conditions and forms of social organization and decision making on the intensity of natural resource depletion. The results will be particularly germane for the ongoing debate on the role of ""people in parks"" and on the contribution that indigenous peoples will make to biodiversity conservation worldwide. The geographical location of this study is significant unto itself. Roraima covers a large portion of the unstudied and largely unmanaged high diversity Guiana Shield forest-savanna transition. The area, which grades from dry savannas through mesic and wet forests to montane cloud forest and tepui habitats, represents one of the last wilderness areas on Earth. For this key ecological area, the future of biodiversity lies in the hands of indigenous peoples. This study will provide key insights regarding how the internal cultural dynamics of indigenous societies influence and are influenced by biodiversity patterns and ecosystem function, with implications for human-environment interactions in Raposa and elsewhere where indigenous peoples retain an important presence.

Land management inside the park and development of the winter range outside park boundaries suggests that wildlife management plays out on a landscape mosaic dominated by human decisions, values, and economic considerations. The main objectives of this research project are to gain a better understanding of the relationships between ecosystem dynamics and human decision-making and to use this understanding to construct an ecosystem model that facilitates exploration of plausible future scenarios in a manner that captures the uncertainty associated with complex systems. An investigative team drawn from multiple disciplines and from five different states will develop spatially explicit elk, wolf, and vegetation submodels and will integrate these models to assess the impacts of climate variability, land-use decisions, and economic valuation on the environment under changing conditions. The elk submodel will extend state-of-the-science energetics-based models to include information on changing landscapes and climate/snow conditions that affect winter feeding habits. The investigators will develop predator components that mimic the impacts of the recent wolf reintroduction in Yellowstone. The snow/climate submodel will be developed to produce snow depth and snow condition maps based on local and large-scale climate parameters and field measurements. Vegetation submodels will focus on willows and aspen, plants that often are browsed heavily by elk. The investigators will address the impacts of changing groundwater resources on these species to better understand their resilience to the combined impacts of elk browse and groundwater stress. Because elk, vegetation, and other factors have become measures by which humans place values on the landscape that influence decisions, stakeholder groups will be studied and interviewed to assure that the resulting models have relevance in the socio-political context of the NEWR. This is particularly important, because stakeholders have a long history of conflict regarding land-use decisions. This project will develop a land-use history, define key stakeholder-identified variables, and use probability-based land-use models. Knowledge derived from stakeholder studies will be integrated into the natural system models as coefficients of habitat availability and quality; as parameters on barriers, sources and sinks; as qualitative and categorical constraints on modeled variables and relationships; and as feedback loops between the human and natural system. The natural and human system submodels will be combined within the context of a single multi-agent system that can model complex adaptive systems. The multi-agent system-based model will be used to simulate alternative states that result from assumptions about decisions, natural conditions, and ecosystem processes. The results will demonstrate the complex nature of a highly integrated ecosystem and the role that climate, human decisions, and natural variability play in producing ecosystem change and/or stability. This research will merge models of ecosystems and human decision-making. A primary focus is to build robust ecosystem models that can be integrated with a human system model based on land use decisions and valuation of ecosystem services. By interacting with NEWR stakeholders and by developing key linkages within natural and human systems, this project will evaluate existing and potential land-use strategies and alternative policy options. The models will demonstrate the complex interactions that exist within this changing landscape by simulating climate factors, policy decisions, and natural change in the vegetation. Models will be extended to simulate potential future conditions based on sound scientific principles, past trends in human decision making, and possible future human decisions. Scenarios may be used to help build consensus and diminish conflict in the NEWR before decisions are made. The NEWR is a critical component of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, and understanding the complexity associated with human and natural system dynamics will help sustain the area for future generations.

Research into how such coastlines evolve over spatial scales of kilometers to hundreds of kilometers and over time scales of decades and longer has just begun. Recent work has revealed surprising long-range interactions, with changes in one location directly affecting distant parts of the coastline. Human efforts to stabilize the shoreline position -- especially through artificial sand placement or ""beach nourishment"" -- are becoming increasingly prevalent, and these localized manipulations likely affect how entire coastlines evolve through their long-range as well as regional effects. This research project will incorporate human manipulations into an enhanced computer model of large-scale, long-term coastline change caused by wave-driven sediment transport. Addressing the behaviors of the fully coupled human-natural system will require developing a model that represents how humans respond to coastline changes, especially local shoreline erosion. Such a model will be based on (1) data that incorporates historical beach-nourishment decisions and economic variables; (2) economic theory;( 3) information gathered during a workshop involving coastal managers, engineers, policy makers, and stakeholders; and (4) scenarios of federal beach-nourishment subsidies, future expense of procuring beach-quality sand, and policy constraints arising from ecological concerns. The resulting coupled model will allow investigations of the types of coastline behaviors to be expected in coming decades and centuries in the context of likely climate change and the consequent changes in storm and wave patterns as well as accelerated sea-level-rise. The coastline of the Carolinas will be used as an initial case study to test the model. Developing the social science component of the modeling endeavor will involve the first examination of how beach nourishment decisions are made. Experiments using the coupled human-coastline model will provide the first examination of how human-influenced coastlines evolve, and more specifically, how actions taken at one location are likely to affect other coastal communities in far-flung locations as well as nearby. The potential insights gained through this work could help coastal managers and planners avoid surprises arising from such spillover effects, which could be especially important as climate change and direct human manipulations become more important factors affecting coastline change. A dedicated website and targeted communications will facilitate dissemination of the main lessons to interested coastal planners and stakeholders.

Policy interventions that could foster this alternative pathway are poorly understood, however, in part because of the complex interactions among ecological, economic, and climatic systems operating across multiple scales spatial and temporal scales in the Amazon region. The interdisciplinary research project will develop quantitative, spatially explicit models of Amazon land-use change, fire, vegetation dynamics, and carbon flux for a major new highway corridor and for the entire basin. The ecosystem model will describe fire risk as a function of drought, land use, and disturbance history, and will be coupled to the economic models through land-use effects on the fire regime and through fire-risk effects on the behavior of land users. The ecosystem model will track vegetation structure and recovery with associated carbon pools to estimate the carbon fluxes and flammability associated with land-use scenarios. The economic models will first calculate the potential profitability of each pixel for competing agricultural and forestry land uses as a function of infrastructure and biophysical factors determined using satellite data and a large GIS database. Land uses that actually occupy each pixel will depend on population and urbanization variables that are captured within an econometric model of municipal-level census data and spatial associations that are represented within a cellular automata model.

For example, substantial improvements in water quality and clarity in Lake Erie achieved in the 1970s and 1980s through the reduction in external phosphorus loadings from point sources have been followed by a period of lakeside recreational and residential development that extends to the present. More recently, increases in phosphorus concentrations and the frequency of harmful algal blooms in the lake have combined with other biophysical conditions to generate ""surprise events,"" such as the, expansion of the summertime ""Dead Zone"" and adult gamefish kills. While linkages between the human and biophysical systems clearly are key factors producing these changes, their underlying structural dynamics and the extent to which the linkages have led to fundamental and perhaps irreversible changes in biological and human processes is unknown. This interdisciplinary research project will examine the coupled linkages between lake functioning and lake-related human activities and explore how these couplings generate nonlinear changes in ecological outcomes, such as water quality and fish stocks, and human behavior, including land use and lake-based recreational activities. Of particular interest are the conditions under which coupled linkages lead to bifurcations or other ""surprise"" outcomes that may not occur in their absence and the influence of fine-scale variations, time-delayed feedbacks, and stochastic processes that may be embedded in the couplings. The objectives of this research are (1) to construct a simple, coarse-scale model of a generic large lake ecosystem with coupled human-biophysical interactions that can be used to examine system dynamics and the role of human-biophysical couplings; (2) to develop a more detailed, fine-scale model by increasing the model's spatial and temporal resolution and, parameterizing the model using Lake Erie data and use this model to test hypotheses regarding the impact of human activities on lake eutrophication and the impact of these ecological changes on land and economic development in the Lake Erie region; and (3) to use this set of models to study the impacts of historical policies and new management strategies of large lakes on both human and biophysical processes. A combination of analytical, statistical, and computer simulation methods, including agent-based modeling, will be used to build these models. Dynamical systems techniques, including numerical simulations and bifurcation analysis, will be used to analyze the models. Much of the historical data on lake dynamics, water quality, fish stocks, land use, and recreational activities are already available. Additional data will be generated using geographical information systems, remote sensing, and household surveys of residents and lake recreational users. The project will provide both scientific and societal benefits. By testing hypotheses regarding the coupled linkages between human and biophysical large lake processes and examining the way in which these interactions influence the self-organization and resiliency of biological and human systems, the project will make an original contribution to the scientific understanding of large lake biocomplexity. The research will make methodological contributions by advancing methods used to study the stability and multiscale properties of complex, coupled systems. By providing a better understanding of how feedbacks occur between lake functioning and human behavioral responses, the results will generate social benefits by providing information to policy makers who seek to protect lake resources while also providing high-quality amenities to people. The project will integrate biocomplexity research and education through the development of a new biocomplexity course; through training a new generation of interdisciplinary biocomplexity researchers; and through incorporation of research ideas and results into K-12 educational materials and programs aimed at policy makers and the broader public.

Of particular interest are the conditions under which coupled linkages lead to bifurcations or other ""surprise"" outcomes that may not occur in their absence and the influence of fine-scale variations, time-delayed feedbacks, and stochastic processes that may be embedded in the couplings. The objectives of this research are (1) to construct a simple, coarse-scale model of a generic large lake ecosystem with coupled human-biophysical interactions that can be used to examine system dynamics and the role of human-biophysical couplings; (2) to develop a more detailed, fine-scale model by increasing the model's spatial and temporal resolution and, parameterizing the model using Lake Erie data and use this model to test hypotheses regarding the impact of human activities on lake eutrophication and the impact of these ecological changes on land and economic development in the Lake Erie region; and (3) to use this set of models to study the impacts of historical policies and new management strategies of large lakes on both human and biophysical processes. A combination of analytical, statistical, and computer simulation methods, including agent-based modeling, will be used to build these models. Dynamical systems techniques, including numerical simulations and bifurcation analysis, will be used to analyze the models. Much of the historical data on lake dynamics, water quality, fish stocks, land use, and recreational activities are already available. Additional data will be generated using geographical information systems, remote sensing, and household surveys of residents and lake recreational users. The project will provide both scientific and societal benefits. By testing hypotheses regarding the coupled linkages between human and biophysical large lake processes and examining the way in which these interactions influence the self-organization and resiliency of biological and human systems, the project will make an original contribution to the scientific understanding of large lake biocomplexity. The research will make methodological contributions by advancing methods used to study the stability and multiscale properties of complex, coupled systems. By providing a better understanding of how feedbacks occur between lake functioning and human behavioral responses, the results will generate social benefits by providing information to policy makers who seek to protect lake resources while also providing high-quality amenities to people. The project will integrate biocomplexity research and education through the development of a new biocomplexity course; through training a new generation of interdisciplinary biocomplexity researchers; and through incorporation of research ideas and results into K-12 educational materials and programs aimed at policy makers and the broader public.

The central organizing principle is that landscape patterns and changes in river and road network structure and function are explained by energy and time optimizations of water flows, biota, and humans. The importance of road and river network intersections in determining dynamic changes to landscapes will be tested using individual/agent-based simulation modeling that integrates field-based physical, biological, and social models. The investigators will focus on the road-river linkages because river ecosystems are vulnerable to human-related perturbations that are related to road access, such as invasion by non-native species and over-harvesting of fish and shellfish. The main overarching hypothesis is that an integrated, individual-based model will more accurately predict environmental effects than any single physical, biotic, or social model by reducing unexplained variation. The mechanism generating this reduction in variance results from including cross-disciplinary connections and corresponding agent feedbacks that otherwise would be missing in the individual disciplinary models. In order to test this hypothesis, the investigators will develop an integrated individual-based model of physical, biotic, and social networks. Through analyses of a case study in Puerto Rico, the investigators expect to demonstrate that river and road intersections bring about interaction of aquatic species and visitors with mutual feedbacks. Dynamic interactions are captured by interdependent functions of each individual agent on each other and each subsystem. The approach therefore will integrate multidisciplinary field studies in geomorphology, engineering, aquatic ecology, and social science into a unified, individual-based model that will evaluate different dimensions of interacting human and natural systems. The experimental design and modeling will rely on an existing natural continuum of land use, road densities, and road types within a network structure that reflects a hierarchy of land uses as well as geomorphic and riverine features. The project will make theoretical, policy, and educational contributions to societal understanding of biocomplexity. In terms of education, two high school teacher workshops will demonstrate the use of web-based GIS models to actively engage high school seniors (and their teachers) in Puerto Rico and Colorado. The project will involve extensive participation by undergraduate and graduate research assistants and multi-institution graduate seminars in biocomplexity that will directly engage students, faculty investigators, and managers in the implementation and integration of interdisciplinary research. Graduate students at University of Puerto Rico will obtain field data on ecological and economic values of rivers in Puerto Rico. The results will also provide information about the consequences of building new roads and closing existing roads in tropical rainforest settings. The findings regarding how individual/agent-based models are effective in integrating and visualizing feedback from physical, biological, and social network interactions will be disseminated.

Crop gene flow is the result of both natural processes like wind dispersal of pollen and human processes like the planting of seeds in fields. Theoretical and empirical studies have focused on gene flow at the local and landscape scale, but they generally have neglected gene flow on the global scale. The controversy surrounding the unintended movement of engineered genes (transgenes) has raised awareness that new alleles can move rapidly and over great distances. No models have emerged to evaluate the spread of crop transgenes through both natural and human processes over time and space, nor have human impacts on gene flow been explored yet. This interdisciplinary research project will focus on the development of an integrated model to describe the dynamics of dispersal of a new crop transgene in space and time. A benefit of focusing on transgene flow is that it affords examples of alleles whose age and origins are known. The model will evolve with iterative interactions between three research teams. The initial model will use corn (Zea mays, maize) in the U.S. and Mexico as a model system, but the model eventually will be adapted for other crop systems, such as canola. Furthermore, the project will move beyond the initial two-nation focus to explore transgene spread at the global scale. One research team will have the construction of the model as its primary assignment. The model will start with a structure of simple natural dispersal processes. The other two teams will make conceptual contributions for refining the model, such as (1) natural processes that affect dispersal patterns like wind directionality, timing of plant flowering, and the spatial distribution of cross-compatible wild relatives, and (2) human processes that affect dispersal patterns like farmer management and choice of seeds for replanting or transport of seed through local and international trade. Those teams will also contribute novel data and pre-existing data from the literature for modifying and testing the model. The teams then will evaluate the refined model for (1) natural impacts, such as the evolution of weediness or the loss of biodiversity in wild relatives, and (2) human impacts, such as evolution of trade policy in response to unintended transgenes in the food supply or changes in traditionally based agricultural systems precipitated by the presence of transgenes in local varieties. New gene-flow influences resulting from these consequences will then be incorporated into the model. Examples include (1) the spatial spread of the transgene into expanding weed populations and (2) international trade barriers or changing labor migration patterns. The evolutionary results from the model will be compared with real spatial and temporal changes in corn transgene frequencies in Mexico. Regular meetings of the research teams will serve to improve the integrative model while providing new opportunities to scrutinize the constraints and consequences of dispersal. The final product will be a global model that can be generalized to describe for the spread of any plant allele as constrained by human and natural processes. The project will have significant implications for predicting plant gene dispersal under natural and human dispersal. It will thus have implications for the spread of invasive organisms as well as for its focus of transgene flow. The topic of transgene flow is a part of the greater public discussion of genetic engineering. The results of the project will have direct relevance to addressing critical issues like the unintended spread of engineered genes that have been reported occurring adventitiously in non-engineered crop varieties, in Mexican corn despite a multiyear moratorium against planting transgenic corn in that country, and in natural populations. The results of this study therefore will provide that scientific input to inform both lay audiences and policy makers at both the national and international levels.

Lake Victoria, the largest freshwater lake in Africa, is home to fisheries that contribute to the food and livelihood security of over 40 million people. The introduction of two species of fish, Nile perch and tilapia, has greatly changed the ecology of the lake. While introduced fishes provide income for fishers, they have apparently caused dramatic declines in the abundance of many native species in the lake. One exception is the sardine-like mukene, which supports the largest fishery in the lake and serves as a critical link between the ecology of the lake and the human populations that depend on the lake for food and income. Food security is inherently tied to civil unrest and eastern Africa has been one of the most war-torn regions of the world since the mid-1990s. Martial conflict significantly suppresses fish catch, which harms food security via decreased food availability and loss of livelihood among fishers. Food insecurity can in turn accelerate political violence. This project will investigate how changes in the ecology of Lake Victoria affect food security, and how conflict affects fishing in the Lake. In collaboration with regional fisheries organizations in Kenya and Uganda, the project aims to a) develop understanding of the relationships between fish abundance, fishery catch and effort, conflict processes, and food security; b) generate estimates of fish abundance using statistical analyses; and c) identify the important links in the system through dynamic structural equation modeling. Researchers will employ geographic information systems to relate fish catch and effort to food commodity prices in regional markets, and use existing data on the occurrence of conflict to relate prices, conflict, and catch. These efforts will contribute significantly to understanding the role of natural resources in conflict and conflict effects on local food security. There is an urgent need to improve understanding of the links between human and natural systems in the Lake Victoria basin. The human population is growing rapidly on the shore of the lake, accelerating impacts on ecosystem services such as water for drinking and irrigation and fishes for food.

Increasingly, degradation of limited water resources is identified as an important and urgent problem facing much of the world, in particular Africa. This research project will evaluate coupled human and ecological drivers influencing water quality, and the health of human and animal populations in the Chobe River Region of Botswana. The investigators will use Escherichia coli as a model microorganism to track transmission linkages between the Chobe River and different trophic guilds of wildlife, domestic animals, and humans in the system. Using predictive models calibrated with field samples the researchers will investigate long-term effects of climatic changes; seasonal variation in hydrology; increases in human population; and landscape modification impacts on water quality and human and animal health. This project will identify markers of high-risk environments where coupled human-natural systems influence water quality, forming the foundation of an early-warning system that can be used by communities and governments to improve preparedness and interventions. This project integrates educational and government outreach into a research approach, which aims to develop a more predictive and fundamental understanding of the present and future impact of coupled dynamics of societal change and development on water quality and health and the potential long-term influence of climate change on these interactions. This research project establishes multidisciplinary scientific networks and international partnerships. The project will support a graduate student-training program between the USA and Botswana, which is integrated with a multifaceted outreach program directed at Botswana youth living in the study area. This approach will strengthen cross-cultural understanding and minority-leadership capacity in scientific discovery. This study promises direct benefits to society through the translation of research findings into developmental policy that will promote the sustainability ecosystems on which human populations depend. Results from this project will advance our understanding of coupled human-natural systems and the influence this has on water quality and health for humans, livestock, and wildlife.","Water-restricted environments that experience strong seasonal variation are extremely vulnerable to landscape alteration and pollution from human activities.

Three hypotheses will be tested: climate change will increase fuel loads and wildfire hazard; land development will increase the area of wildland-urban interface and alter vegetation in ways that increase the risk of wildfire and loss of imperiled ecosystems; and some management options will be more robust than others in mitigating fire risk and sustaining imperiled ecosystems across a range of future climate scenarios. The work will employ a biophysical model that downscales from the coarse spatial scales of current climate change models to the fine spatial scales at which human land use and management decisions are made, and then scales back up to represent the landscape-scale effects of human actions on vegetation and fire hazard. The biophysical model will be coupled with an agent-based model in which decision makers on individual land parcels respond to climate, land use regulation and incentives, land markets, perceived fire hazard, land management costs, and aesthetics. This research will advance knowledge of how to bridge key theoretical and practical issues related to multiple types of system uncertainties, different spatial and temporal scales, and complex interactions and feedbacks among coupled natural and human systems. The risk of catastrophic wildfire in the wildland-urban interface is a growing nationwide threat that projected climate change is likely to exacerbate. This project supports emerging national, regional and local initiatives by providing tools to forecast risks and mitigate the impacts. Global climate change models have become increasingly mechanistic, sophisticated and spatially explicit. However, the development of interactive models of how biological and human cultural systems will respond to climate change at the spatial scales at which land use and management decisions are made is in its infancy. This research will produce a transferable methodology for modeling such systems that is tractable, spatially explicit, and directly linked to policy-based decision-making. The development of solutions that are robust to future uncertainties is an important approach toward adaptively managing complex systems that include strongly coupled ecological and socio-economic processes.

Typically these areas require active, sustained management intervention, usually in the form of restoration activities (e.g., removal of invasive species, use of prescribed fire), in order to realize the biodiversity conservation objectives set for them. Chicago Wilderness is a consortium of over 240 organizations that has as its primary goal the conservation, restoration and management of biodiversity on 360,000 acres of protected open space in the greater Chicago area. This research will use ongoing efforts in the woodlands and savannas of Chicago Wilderness as a model for investigating how the restoration and conservation planning process affects biodiversity outcomes in complex metropolitan landscapes. Several related research approaches will be utilized, including development of models to explore how interactions among different constituencies may lead to different restoration and management practices, and in turn, how these practices affect biodiversity outcomes. Documenting the range of biodiversity outcomes in woodland and savanna restoration sites across the Chicago region will permit a test of hypotheses about the relationship between distinct models of the restoration planning process (traditional, co-management, grassroots) and biodiversity. Thus, the project will research the impact of humans, via the planning process, on biodiversity in an urban context, and also the reciprocal influence of these biodiversity outcomes on different members of the human community. The project will add to knowledge of the connections between conservation management planning and the biodiversity results that emerge from its implementation. The project will generate results relevant to the conservation of habitats of global significance (e.g. oak savanna, oak woodlands, and tallgrass prairie) while simultaneously enhancing the understanding of institutional responses to the challenges of balancing multiple objectives and incorporating heterogeneous sources of information into the planning process.

The project will generate results relevant to the conservation of habitats of global significance (e.g. oak savanna, oak woodlands, and tallgrass prairie) while simultaneously enhancing the understanding of institutional responses to the challenges of balancing multiple objectives and incorporating heterogeneous sources of information into the planning process. The results will be broadly applicable to other complex metropolitan landscapes throughout the U.S. and the world.

In the Cordillera Blanca, the most glacierized mountain range in the tropics, the natural and social systems of the region are very dependent on glacial water resources and it is considered to be one of the most vulnerable to glacier-related water stress in the world. This interdisciplinary and collaborative research project will evaluate the new system of freshwater governance that is emerging in the Andes and how glacial dynamics are transforming melt water rates as they rapidly recede. The research will generate new insights into the coupled natural and human consequences of glacial recession in the tropical highlands by examining the combined effects of glacier recession on downstream watersheds, the resilience of livelihood systems and the ways in which economic change and shifting water governance are factors in this hydrologic, ecological, and social transformation. The research will also generate new hydrologic models and derive quantitative estimates of glacial water dynamics.

These unprecedented changes in both demographic factors (e.g., rapid urbanization, international migration, falling rural fertility and mortality) and economic factors (e.g. expansion of non-agricultural industries, decreasing price of agricultural produce, emigrant remittances, emergence of large-scale modern agriculture, and increasing global demand for food and petroleum alternatives) are predicted to lead to the following land-use transitions: 1 ) Extensive conversion of native ecosystems to modern agriculture, particularly in areas with little topographic relief (e.g. soybean production in South American dry forest ecosystems), and 2) Abandonment of marginal agricultural and grazing lands, particularly in mountainous and remote regions, permitting ecosystem recovery.

Many of these impacts are positive (e.g. poverty reduction), but there are also negative effects, particularly for natural systems due to the increasing demand for natural resources of a growing and more affluent population. Furthermore, rural inhabitants, particularly young people, are migrating to regional urban centers or to more developed economies (e.g., the United States), because they are attracted by opportunities of better jobs, education, and health services. These unprecedented changes in both demographic factors (e.g., rapid urbanization, international migration, falling rural fertility and mortality) and economic factors (e.g. expansion of non-agricultural industries, decreasing price of agricultural produce, emigrant remittances, emergence of large-scale modern agriculture, and increasing global demand for food and petroleum alternatives) are predicted to lead to the following land-use transitions: 1 ) Extensive conversion of native ecosystems to modern agriculture, particularly in areas with little topographic relief (e.g. soybean production in South American dry forest ecosystems), and 2) Abandonment of marginal agricultural and grazing lands, particularly in mountainous and remote regions, permitting ecosystem recovery. To test these predictions, the project will combine demographic and socio-economic data from >18,000 municipalities throughout Latin America and Caribbean with remote sensing analyses of land-cover/land-use change for the period 1980-2000. In addition, the project will document how these demographic and land-use changes are affecting natural ecosystem and local inhabitants by conducting ecosystem inventories and household interviews in selected countries. This project will create a large database, which will allow us to model the complex interaction between and among human and natural systems. The study should reveal new concepts that will facilitate society's understanding of the socioeconomic and biodiversity consequences of global change. The major contribution will be a detailed database that integrates demographic, economic, land-use, and ecosystem data at multiple spatial scales. This information will be used to create continental-scale models of land-use change, and these models will be used to facilitate local governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in regional to local planning.

While our understanding of biophysical cross-boundary processes, such as nutrient flows and invasions of exotic species, has improved markedly over the past decade, work on social processes is urgently needed. Two increasingly important cross-boundary social processes impacting nature reserves around the world are rural-urban labor migration (migration of residents from rural areas for urban employment opportunities) and ecotourism (nature-based tourism in rural areas often by city dwellers). These phenomena are especially critical and rapidly evolving in developing countries such as China, which are experiencing unprecedented increases in human mobility due to economic development over the past three decades. However, little is known about the interactive effects of migration and ecotourism on human-nature dynamics. This project will contribute to a better understanding of the effects of these interacting processes on the coupled human-natural system (forests/panda habitat and local residents) in the Wolong Nature Reserve, the flagship reserve for conservation of the world-famous endangered Giant Pandas of China. The project will take a systems approach to address four interrelated objectives: (1) evaluate the effects of ecotourism on the coupled human-natural system; (2) assess the effects of labor migration on the coupled human-natural system; (3) understand the interactive effects of labor migration and ecotourism on the coupled human-natural system, and (4) model and simulate the long-term effects of migration and ecotourism on the coupled human-natural system. The methods to be used in this study include field observations, face-to-face interviews with stakeholders, geographic information systems, remote sensing, global positioning systems, statistical tools, and systems modeling and simulation. The project will tightly integrate research with both formal education from K-12 to graduate school, and with engagement of stakeholders and the general public from local to international levels. This project will contribute to the theoretical understanding of complex human-natural system dynamics, concentrating on crucial characteristics such as nonlinearity, thresholds, feedbacks, and uncertainty that are shaped by cross-boundary processes. The project will also make methodological contributions by advancing the state-of-the-art in agent-based modeling in producing a web-accessible model exploring the complexity of cross-boundary processes.

Carbon exchange is a key indicator of the intensity and pattern of urban metabolism, but the state of science currently does not address the close coupling of carbon exchange within and across human and natural subsystems of urban and urbanizing systems. Almost all research has focused on urban carbon emissions, or separately on urban vegetation carbon exchange. Thus, it is not possible to answer basic questions such as whether natural systems exchange carbon more locally than they do with a metropolitan region. This research will develop an integrated measurement and analysis framework for coupled carbon exchange in an urban-to-rural gradient from Boston to the rural Harvard Forest Long Term Ecological Research Site. This project will combine ground-based measurements of carbon exchange and energy flows with socioeconomic, meteorological and satellite measurements and modeling of human activity and the built and natural environments. These data will be integrated into a dynamic, Geospatial Information System that will characterize extant patterns of carbon exchange from daily to seasonal time scales at sub-meter spatial resolution across the urban-to-rural gradient. This analytical framework will then be used to forecast carbon exchange impacts of future land use change and urban growth scenarios, to advance fundamental knowledge about coupling of carbon exchange in urbanizing systems, and provide policy makers with specific and relevant information to align urban growth planning with sustainability goals. Quantifying climatic, ecological, and socioeconomic drivers of carbon exchange and energy use will allow for forecasting carbon flows and evaluating policies aimed at altering flows consistent with social goals.

For example, this research can be used to evaluate how urban forestry, changes in rooftop albedo, and changes in transportation infrastructure can offset carbon emissions, or to examine how transportation options affect both carbon emissions and the economic opportunities available for urban dwellers.","The urbanization and growth of the human population over past decades has yielded cities of unprecedented size and form, which emit significant quantities of waste, transform habitat, modify major biogeochemical cycles, alter local climate, and diminish human health. Carbon exchange is a key indicator of the intensity and pattern of urban metabolism, but the state of science currently does not address the close coupling of carbon exchange within and across human and natural subsystems of urban and urbanizing systems. Almost all research has focused on urban carbon emissions, or separately on urban vegetation carbon exchange. Thus, it is not possible to answer basic questions such as whether natural systems exchange carbon more locally than they do with a metropolitan region. This research will develop an integrated measurement and analysis framework for coupled carbon exchange in an urban-to-rural gradient from Boston to the rural Harvard Forest Long Term Ecological Research Site. This project will combine ground-based measurements of carbon exchange and energy flows with socioeconomic, meteorological and satellite measurements and modeling of human activity and the built and natural environments. These data will be integrated into a dynamic, Geospatial Information System that will characterize extant patterns of carbon exchange from daily to seasonal time scales at sub-meter spatial resolution across the urban-to-rural gradient. This analytical framework will then be used to forecast carbon exchange impacts of future land use change and urban growth scenarios, to advance fundamental knowledge about coupling of carbon exchange in urbanizing systems, and provide policy makers with specific and relevant information to align urban growth planning with sustainability goals. Quantifying climatic, ecological, and socioeconomic drivers of carbon exchange and energy use will allow for forecasting carbon flows and evaluating policies aimed at altering flows consistent with social goals. For example, this research will help evaluate options for achieving Boston's emissions reduction targets.

Little is known about the interactions between patterns and processes in human dominated landscapes, however. One of the least understood aspects of urban landscape dynamics is the way in which local interactions of humans and biophysical processes generate the landscape patterns of metropolitan regions. Studying the relationships between these interactions and the resulting urban landscape patterns is critical to plan and manage urban growth in ways that minimize the ecological impacts on ecosystems while sustaining economically and socially viable urban communities. This research project will examine urban landscapes as emergent phenomena that result from local interactions of human agents, real estate markets, built infrastructure, and biophysical factors like land cover, geomorphology, and natural disturbance regimes to develop a theory of urban landscape dynamics. The study will employ complex systems, patch dynamics, hierarchical theory, and an agent-based modeling approach to study coupled human-natural dynamics and empirically test this approach in two different bioregions (Seattle and Phoenix). The models will be developed and used to test hypotheses regarding emergent properties of urban landscapes and to enhance basic understanding of humans-ecological interactions in urban landscapes across scales. Urban landscapes exhibit some fundamental features of complex self-organizing systems. They are highly heterogeneous, spatially nested, and hierarchically structured. The urban spatial structure can be described as a cumulative and aggregate pattern that results from numerous local decisions involving a large number of adaptive agents interacting among themselves and with biophysical factors. These behaviors eventually can lead to different metropolitan patterns. This research will address four questions: (1) How do dynamic landscape systems evolve to generate emergent patterns that are evident in urban landscapes? (2) What nonlinearities, thresholds, discontinuities, and path dependencies explain divergent trajectories of urban landscapes? (3) How do emergent urban landscape patterns influence biodiversity and ecosystem functioning? (4) How can planning integrate this knowledge to develop sustainable urban landscape patterns? The model implementation will be based on a dynamic probabilistic relational model (DPRM) in which parameters and spatial rules are estimated empirically from two longitudinal land-cover and land-use data sets developed for the Seattle and Phoenix metropolitan areas.

A city is a unique type of ecosystem where human social, economic, and cultural activities play a prominent role in shaping the landscape, which, in turn, influences the distribution and abundance of other species and consequent patterns of biodiversity. The long-term sustainability of cities is of increasing concern as they continue to grow, straining their infrastructure and pushing against environmental constraints on available natural resources. A key natural resource is water, especially in the more rapidly urbanizing arid regions of the world. Understanding water management and use in cities therefore is critical to developing a deeper theoretical understanding of urban ecosystems as well as effective urban policy. The American West faces a water crisis. Drought, urban growth, climate change, and the continued demands of agriculture have combined to heighten the competition among water users and spurred the search for institutional arrangements to conserve water. Common tools used by governments to regulate and reduce water consumption are the water meter and a use-based pricing structure. In the rapidly urbanizing San Joaquin Valley of California, which is located in an arid region subject to prolonged drought cycles likely to be exacerbated under regional climate change projections, many cities now are installing meters to reduce household water use. Metering is expected to reduce water availability throughout the urban ecosystem, with residential landscaping choices mediating its effects upon the distribution of plants and animals. Urban land-use decisions result from dynamic interactions between institutional and individual-level factors. Landscaping and irrigation at any particular residence, for example, are products of local environmental conditions, the homeowners' cultural preferences, socioeconomic status, neighborhood dynamics, zoning laws, market conditions, city policies, and county/state/federal government regulations. Because land use is a key determinant of habitat for other species, overall urban biodiversity is strongly driven by the outcome of interactions between these variables, but these interactions remain poorly understood. This research project will address the significance of water as a key resource shaping regional patterns of landscape and biodiversity in the Fresno-Clovis metropolitan area of central California. Fresno currently is installing water meters and will start charging for use by 2013, while Clovis has been doing so for almost a century. This contrast in water policies between the two cities provides a unique comparative experimental opportunity to study the impact of metering on human landscaping choices and consequent patterns of urban biodiversity. The objectives of this project are to analyze and contrast current patterns of water use in these cities by focusing on institutional policy and decision making regarding metering; individual homeowner decision making about landscaping; landscape structure at multiple spatial scales; and patterns in the distribution of plant and bird diversity. The investigators will employ a range of methods from multiple disciplines including field observations, institutional and individual homeowner surveys, face-to-face interviews with stakeholders, geographical information systems, remote sensing, global positioning systems, statistical tools, systems modeling, and advanced computer visualization techniques. In addition to addressing many fundamental ecological and socioeconomic questions, the research will be tightly integrated with the education of undergraduate and graduate students and a strong citizen science component built upon the ongoing Fresno Bird Count project. The project will have significant implications for urban socioecological theory, methodology, and application. In terms of theory, this project will shed light on complex dynamics of interrelated processes among government regulatory policies, human behavior, landscape and habitat structure, and plant and bird distribution at multiple spatial and temporal scales. In terms of methodology, the research will integrate multidisciplinary methods and advanced technologies to investigate the complexity of the study system, leveraging a ""natural"" experiment occurring due to Fresno's installation of water meters, and involving citizen scientist participation in data gathering. With respect to broader impacts, the project will provide practical information for urban governance by measuring the impact of a common regulatory tool on citizen behavior and its resulting impacts on landscape and biodiversity. Understanding the relationships among institutions, individual citizens, and biodiversity will help guide urban planning towards more sustainable, resilient, and environmentally healthy cities in the region and throughout the world.

A city is a unique type of ecosystem where human social, economic, and cultural activities play a prominent role in shaping the landscape, which, in turn, influences the distribution and abundance of other species and consequent patterns of biodiversity. The long-term sustainability of cities is of increasing concern as they continue to grow, straining their infrastructure and pushing against environmental constraints on available natural resources. A key natural resource is water, especially in the more rapidly urbanizing arid regions of the world. Understanding water management and use in cities therefore is critical to developing a deeper theoretical understanding of urban ecosystems as well as effective urban policy. The American West faces a water crisis. Drought, urban growth, climate change, and the continued demands of agriculture have combined to heighten the competition among water users and spurred the search for institutional arrangements to conserve water. Common tools used by governments to regulate and reduce water consumption are the water meter and a use-based pricing structure. In the rapidly urbanizing San Joaquin Valley of California, which is located in an arid region subject to prolonged drought cycles likely to be exacerbated under regional climate change projections, many cities now are installing meters to reduce household water use. Metering is expected to reduce water availability throughout the urban ecosystem, with residential landscaping choices mediating its effects upon the distribution of plants and animals. Urban land-use decisions result from dynamic interactions between institutional and individual-level factors. Landscaping and irrigation at any particular residence, for example, are products of local environmental conditions, the homeowners' cultural preferences, socioeconomic status, neighborhood dynamics, zoning laws, market conditions, city policies, and county/state/federal government regulations. Because land use is a key determinant of habitat for other species, overall urban biodiversity is strongly driven by the outcome of interactions between these variables, but these interactions remain poorly understood. This research project will address the significance of water as a key resource shaping regional patterns of landscape and biodiversity in the Fresno-Clovis metropolitan area of central California. Fresno currently is installing water meters and will start charging for use by 2013, while Clovis has been doing so for almost a century. This contrast in water policies between the two cities provides a unique comparative experimental opportunity to study the impact of metering on human landscaping choices and consequent patterns of urban biodiversity. The objectives of this project are to analyze and contrast current patterns of water use in these cities by focusing on institutional policy and decision making regarding metering; individual homeowner decision making about landscaping; landscape structure at multiple spatial scales; and patterns in the distribution of plant and bird diversity.

The hyper-extractive economic system of Southwest Kansas survives and thrives by externalizing the costs of production, at every step along the production chain, onto society, the economy, and natural systems of the region. Hyper-extractive practices produce economic and resource path dependencies, which when placed in relation with global processes such as international migration and the emergence of global commodity chains, shape future patterns of population growth and economic development. Our research asks which changes in the parameters of irrigated agriculture will produce sustainable uses of the aquifer without jeopardizing the region's economy. To model this system, we use an integrated, cross-disciplinary, system-level, theoretical approach developed by the Consortium for Global Research on Water-Based Economies at KSU By linking land and water use patterns, economic trends and population dynamics to issues of sustainability, we focus on 1) accurately modeling the current hyper-extractive system, 2) forecasting the outcome of possible policy approaches to transition the current system toward possible paths that are more sustainable for the social, economic and natural systems of the groundwater-based economies of the High Plains Aquifer, and 3) communicating the model's outcomes to stakeholders and policy-makers for the purpose of developing legislation to implement policy changes designed to enhance sustainability. This holistic, interdisciplinary approach has broad application to other hyper-extractive economic systems in the High Plains, Africa, Asia, and South America. It will help researchers, students and stakeholders representing different fields and interest areas to work together on commonly-discussed but differently interpreted concepts such as sustainability and path dependence. Collaboration with the Steward County Community College will bring in underrepresented groups and help disseminating knowledge and interdisciplinary perspective on environmental stewardship at the local level. The involvement of researchers, educators, students, elected leaders and stakeholders ensures the development of a healthy dialogue about sustainability issues and the possibility of changing policy to implement some combination of reforms to enhance regional sustainability.

Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity: Earth moving by humans associated with agriculture, urbanization, and excavation re-contours entire landscapes and constitutes a major geological force within the critical zone of planet Earth. The Critical Zone, defined as the terrestrial layer extending from tree tops through the groundwater and into stream networks, sustains most terrestrial life on the planet. At a greater rate than ever in Earth?s history, erosion and excavation expose sub-soil materials and unweathered minerals, which mix into and within soils, and are transported as sediment loads through river networks from headwaters to estuaries. To quantify the impacts on the global carbon cycle of humans as geological agents, a multidisciplinary team of scientists from University of Delaware (UD) and Stroud Water Research Center (SWRC) will establish a Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) within the 1440 km2 Christina River drainage basin (CRB/CZO). Scientific investigations within the CRB/CZO, located in SE Pennsylvania and N. Delaware and straddling unglaciated Piedmont and Coastal Plain physiographic provinces, will test the following overarching hypothesis: Humans, by accelerating the introduction of minerals into biologically and chemically active zones significantly enhance the interactions between minerals and organic matter and create globally significant impacts on the exchange of carbon between land and the atmosphere. The human footprint within the CRB/CZO spans centuries and current land uses include second growth forests, agriculture, and suburban and urban development This provides an ideal natural laboratory in which we will investigate fundamental biological, chemical, and geological processes within the critical zone along a gradient of human impacts. We will particularly focus on the sources, transport and fates of water, sediments and carbon from uplands to inland waters and from inland waters to the coastal zone. The CRB/CZO will utilize cutting edge technologies for real-time gathering of hydrological, physical and chemical data and advances in cyber-infrastructure that seamlessly merge real-time data with state-of-the-art graphics tools to provide timely open access to quality controlled data and supporting materials. Field installations and data management advances will enhance an extensive existing network of stations used for monitoring water flow and water chemistry within the CRB basin, including Delaware Coastal Waters, and will build upon a solid foundation of decades of research conducted by UD, SWRC, and numerous state, federal, and non-governmental agencies. Broader impacts of the proposed activity: The proposed CRB/CZO will serve as a resource to the greater scientific community through open access to data and opportunities for research projects that take advantage of the enhanced monitoring network. The new Delaware Environmental Institute (DENIN), located at UD and DE Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) will partner with the CRB/CZO on outreach activities. Public outreach to stake holders within the Christina Basin is a critical step in making CRB/CZO data available to policy makers. Strong ties between UD and Delaware state agencies will enhance the sharing of environmental data and will provide outreach to the public and policy makers. Some of our outreach will be coordinated through the Water Resources Agency, part of the UD Institute for Public Administration. The Christina Basin Water Quality Management Committee, which includes representatives from 15 federal, state, and local environmental resource agencies, hosts an annual series of public workshops to identify the science needs of policy makers. We will incorporate science results from the CRB/CZO into these workshops with the goal of providing a direct interface between science and public policy. The SWRC maintains 4 full-time staff members to translate our research into educational programs for middle- and high schoolaged students, teachers, and citizen/conservation groups.

Are these surprises a consequence of the complexity or nonlinearity of natural-social systems? Or can they be explained by simpler processes? This research project addresses this question for systems composed of lakes, their riparian vegetation and land use, and social and economic organizations of lake users.

Are these surprises a consequence of the complexity or nonlinearity of natural-social systems? Or can they be explained by simpler processes? This research project addresses this question for systems composed of lakes, their riparian vegetation and land use, and social and economic organizations of lake users. The investigators will study the self-organization of lake users and associated characteristics of shoreline and lake ecosystems. The project will determine whether thresholds in riparian organization set the stage for an important class of surprises: collapses of economically important game fish stocks.

Guiding thematic questions include the role of societal drivers in land use change, how such change affects watershed ecosystems and especially their receiving waters, how altered watersheds and receiving waters affect fish habitat and fisheries, and how we can determine thresholds in metastable ecosystems beyond which they will undergo a change to an alternate stable state, particularly one that is inimical to society and ecosystem services. Limburg proposes a bold agenda for integrating ecosystem science with fisheries and societal drivers in linked teaching and research projects. The programmatic theme that unifies the elements is watershed science, which is emerging as a major focus at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF). All of these questions are ones the PI has begun to work on, but for which much remains to be done. The PI's expertise in fisheries, ecosystem analysis and ecological economics will be brought to bear and further developed by collaborative projects, teaching, mentoring, and workshops. The proposed program will interface well with extant ESF programs in Hydrosystems Science, Fisheries and Aquatic Science, Ecological Economics, and Urban Ecology. By working with the Department Chair and a suite of mentors both internal and external to ESF, the PI will assess the success of the program in its ability to produce meaningful, life-long learning and scholarship. Too often today, research and teaching are splintered into narrow disciplines, and as a consequence, students and researchers often find it difficult to deal with complex environmental problems. This program will enable a new generation of interdisciplinary scientists to be trained in a combination of a wide array of subjects, including fish migration, the use of biochemical markers and ecological economics.","ABSTRACT Dr. Karin Limburg's five-year CAREER award will establish a highly integrated and interdisciplinary research and education plan to develop research and learning experiences in settled watersheds and connected receiving waters (including fresh, brackish, and coastal marine).

Within North America, intentional wildfire has almost certainly been widespread for over 5,000 years in what is now California, and may have changed the ecology and driven the evolution of species in woodlands in ways that in turn affect the ability of people to obtain natural resources. This project will measure direct effects of indigenous burning practices on woodlands and low-elevation, mixed forests in the Central Valley, Klamath Mountains, and Sierra Nevada, and indirect effects of these practices on the availability of wild foods and materials used by indigenous peoples that inhabit the woodlands. Researchers will quantify differences in plant species composition between areas burned by local groups of Native Americans and areas subject to fire suppression, and test effects of burning practices on the regeneration of oaks that dominate the woodlands and on infestation of their acorns by insects. Detailed studies of time required to harvest and process foods and materials such as stems for construction of household items will show whether burning does in fact improve resource availabilities for people. This work will take a scientific look at a potentially very important interplay between humans and nature that has been the subject of intensive debate but little quantitative study. The project personnel will collaborate with tribal and other land managers to develop a better understanding of how to manage fire to achieve social goals and to restore and maintain natural systems. As currently managed, much of California's oak woodlands and low-elevation conifer forests ecosystems are under a threat of high-intensity, destructive wildfires.

An important example is public policy to control aquatic species invasions, which are often a major threat to native species and biodiversity, and consequently to the social value of aquatic ecosystems. This project investigates how policy interventions intended to control or prevent harmful aquatic species invasions affect the decisions and economic welfare of individuals using the aquatic system, and consequently the spatial dynamics of invasions. This question will be addressed for aquatic invasive species (AIS) now present in the lake district of northern Wisconsin, such as Eurasian water-milfoil, rusty crayfish, and zebra mussel. The analysis uses a variety of new data and methods, including an econometric model of boater behavior estimated with data from a two-year, web-based survey of boaters, novel experiments and analyses concerning propagule uptake by boats leaving infected lakes and propagule survival during transport, and a statistical model of the lake characteristics affecting propagule establishment and colonization. As well as advancing understanding of aquatic species invasions, results will generally inform human-environment studies through the development of innovative models that incorporate uncertainties in human behaviors. On a practical level, the project will have broad impacts via its insights into basic management questions about AIS. For example, historically, management resources have been directed primarily towards invasive species control, possibly because of the political economy of invasions. But in reality, the appropriate management action is likely to be a mix of control and prevention; and methods falling into each of these categories need further investigation. Multiple graduate students and undergraduates will be trained and mentored in this interdisciplinary research project.

The services from riparian ecosystems in the Southwest United States derive from the presence of water in a dry land and a web of physical, biological and human processes. Southwestern rivers have been significantly altered by human impacts through surface water diversions, damming, groundwater extraction and impacts from land use change. This project seeks to understand how ecosystem services change in response to extraction or addition of water to ecosystems due to population change and climate change. The project will look at how the value of ecosystem services changes in response to decreases in water availability and to increases in water availability to these systems. The standing hypothesis is that once dewatered, restoration of hydrologic conditions will result in a lower level of ecosystem services and value than was originally found in these ecosystems. The utilization of existing data on dewatering and on restoration will provide a robust library of understanding of how the value of ecosystems services in riparian systems change in response to hydrologic and biological conditions. This library of knowledge will then be used to understand how these systems might respond to drivers of change in these systems. Further understanding of the interaction of physical, biological and economic processes in free flowing river systems will better inform management in more controlled and human affected systems such as dammed rivers or rivers with large amounts of diversion for agriculture. Since this project will project the potential effects of future changes in population change and climate change, it is important that these efforts be transferred quickly to the decision-making realm.

The fate of much of the anthropogenic N load to the biosphere is uncertain because mass balance studies of major watersheds show that most of the added N is not exported to the oceans but is missing, having disappeared from our accounting somewhere within these watersheds. Most of the inorganic N entering streams is in the form of nitrate. Traditionally, nitrate has been thought to flow freely downstream to coastal ecosystems. Recently, however, mass balance analyses for the Mississippi drainage have shown that large quantities of nitrate are lost as water travels through its tributary streams. This conclusion is consistent with earlier findings that smaller streams are most retentive of ammonium. This project will be an intensive, inter-site study of the fate of nitrate in streams. The investigators will evaluate whether streams are indeed important sites of N retention in the landscape and how human disturbances affect that retention. Field 15N-tracer experiments will be used to determine the rates and factors controlling nitrate uptake and retention in relatively pristine streams and in disturbed (agricultural and urban) streams. The experimental results will be used to develop a process-based model of nitrate retention in streams. The results will be extended to larger spatial scales using GIS approaches to predict nitrate retention in large river basins at each of eight study sites. These predictions will be tested with synoptic field measurements of stream nitrate concentrations within each basin. The validated river basin model will be an important land-use planning tool for controlling the N loading of lakes and coastal ecosystems. The work will have broader implications to society by explicitly evaluating the effects of human disturbance on N retention in stream networks, contributing the new knowledge needed for a more sustainable management of watersheds.","Human activities are flooding the biosphere with nitrogen (N), changing the biogeochemistry of terrestrial and aquatic environments.

The investigators will focus on the Green Infrastructure Vision of the Chicago Wilderness alliance, a conservation consortium of more than 240 organizations. The Green Infrastructure Vision, designed to implement the Chicago Wilderness Biodiversity Recovery Plan, is already influencing long-range land planning throughout the Chicago metropolitan region. The Green Infrastructure Vision identifies 1.5 million acres of recommended resource protection areas -- lands that need careful planning and management in order to protect the 360,000 acres of already protected lands and waters in the Chicago Wilderness network. Two postdoctoral researchers will work with the ULTRA-Ex research team (who come from a diversity of research institutions and governmental agencies) to accomplish two major objectives. Their first objective is to conduct a critical examination of the connections between the biodiversity-recovery goals of the region-wide Green Infrastructure Vision and the delivery of critical ecosystem services to human communities throughout the Chicago region. The researchers will examine links between social and ecological systems in the context of biodiversity management, green-infrastructure conceptualization and implementation, and the delivery of ecosystem services from cultural to biogeochemical.

This hub will include an interactive platform for managing data, communicating research findings to planners and the public, and collaborating and interacting with scientists and practitioners. It will also be an umbrella and focal point for urban ecosystem research and policy, and it will partner with regional education and outreach programs. This research project will develop new information about biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, green-infrastructure planning, asset-based analysis, and resilience theory. A novel facet of the project is the application of scientific tools to investigate the relationship between the protection of biodiversity and the delivery of a range of ecosystem services in a complex metropolitan landscape. The project will provide scientifically objective information to strengthen planning and conservation practices in the City of Chicago and the entire Chicago metropolitan region.

By the year 2015, this fraction is expected to rise by more than 10 percent. The increasing expansion of urban centers is significantly impacting ecosystem services and the human communities dependent on these services, not least because the biogeophysical environments of urban regions and their surrounds are substantially different from those of rural areas. The effects of this difference can be seen in modified water cycles and climates within urban centers and exurban areas, amended urban soil properties and ecosystem species, and polluted urban airways and waterways. In many cases, degraded urban biogeophysical environments also are contributing to severe health problems among urban populations. Concern about the major ecological impact of urbanization has prompted the development of numerous strategies for improving ecological services within cities, many of which are focused on the preservation and/or recreation of natural landscape features. One strategy that is gaining rapid attention in the U.S. is the concept of an urban Green Area Factor (GAF) program. The goal of a GAF program is to provide a cost-effective, decentralized approach to the restoration or expansion of ecosystem services in urban environments, by setting targets for the percentage of ""greening"" to occur in the development of different parcels of urban land. The use of the GAF as an urban planning tool has multiple potential benefits from the perspectives of improving urban ecology and health, improving the aesthetics and habitability of urban environments, and engaging urban stakeholders in strategies for sustainable development. But despite its potential, scientific linkages between GAF guidelines and ecological outcomes remain nascent. Furthermore, information about U.S. public willingness to provide support and stewardship for various GAF strategies is limited.

Their use of the ice requires detailed knowledge of ice conditions for both safety and success in hunting, their main livelihood. The sea-ice environment in the Arctic is changing, however. Studies of sea-ice characteristics from scientific and indigenous knowledge perspectives have found major changes in the extent and thickness of the Arctic ice pack as well as local and regional changes in certain characteristics like the thickness, stability, and dates of formation of the shorefast ice used by hunters. As a result, Inuit and Inupiat communities are making changes to their day-to-day and long-term livelihood strategies and are dealing with traditional knowledge and skills that are, at times, no longer applicable. At the same time, scientists struggle to understand the interactions of the forces influencing sea-ice changes and variations of change at multiple scales.

GEO-CHN,,grant.2992744,410437,88,10,subset,5,No,BE/CNH: Biocomplexity and Fisheries Sustainability,BE/CNH: Biocomplexity and Fisheries Sustainability,"Humans have exploited animal populations by hunting and fishing for thousands of years, but extensive commercial harvest of animals is now largely limited to aquatic ecosystems. Even in marine ecosystems, evidence has accumulated that many fisheries may not be sustainable. This lack of sustainability stems in part from the inability of the fish populations to generate enough surplus production to meet the expectations of the fisheries. In addition to this biotic dimension, however, there are equally important human dimensions, including regulations, investments in vessels and gear, locations of communities, property rights and fishing licenses, and other traditional and cultural aspects of fishing. Aquatic ecologists have described many aspects of the complexity of biotic systems that affect the productivity of fish populations, including diversity of phsical habitats, effects of changing environmental conditions, intra-specific competition, nutrient cycling, and community dynamics. These studies have not been adequately integrated, however, with work on the complexity of human systems, the commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries that are intimately and inextricably linked to the population dynamics of the fishes. The sockeye salmon fisheries in Bristol Bay, Alaska, present an ideal opportunity to understand the linkages between complex biotic and human systems, thereby extending basic understanding of these critical components of healthy human and natural communities. These fisheries, operating at commercial levels for a century, are among the best examples of sustainability, yet their complexity has only recently been investigated. Sockeye salmon breed in streams, ponds, rivers, and beaches associated with large lakes in five major drainage basins, and their offspring rear in the lakes for one or two years before migrating to sea for another two or three years. Tens of millions of these salmon return as adults each year, and fractions of the total are caught in mobile gillnet fisheries, fixed-site set net fisheries, recreational fisheries, and subsistence fisheries. Forecasts and in-season information are used by managers to decide on appropriate levels of fishing and by fishermen do decide where to fish. The forecasts are based on scientific information derived from research on climate-related and density-dependent processes governing the dynamics of the salmon populations. The primary concepts of interest in this interdisciplinary research project are the resilience of the biotic system (in this case, salmon abundance and diversity) to harvest and environmental change and the resilience of the human communities in the face of these changes in salmon abundance and associated changes in price and costs of fishing. The fundamental hypothesis is that the ability of the salmon populations to persist in the face of changing environmental conditions and the ability of the human communities to persist in the face of changing social and economic forces both depend on the diversity of ""life history"" strategies as well as a blend of site attachment and mobility. The overall objective of this research project is to test this hypothesis and thereby understand the coupling between salmon populations and human communities. The project will pursue this objective with five themes at increasing levels of scale: (1) the links between genetics and life history traits of salmon that result from post-glacial colonization and contemporary homing and gene flow, (2) the role of climate in determining the productivity of salmon populations using different breeding habitats and different nursery lakes, (3) the importance of marine-derived nutrients (from salmon carcasses) in the productivity of lake ecosystems and success of salmon populations, (4) the ways in which the current fishery management policy of maximum sustainable yield could be modified to consider economic and ecological processes to the benefit of both humans and the natural ecosystem, and (5) the extent to which the regulatory policies should consider the behavior of fishermen in an effort to rationalize the size and capacity of the fisheries. The project will be closely coordinated with the agency regulating the fisheries (Alaska Department of Fish and Game) and the community development organizations in the area (especially the Bristol Bay Native Association). Outreach efforts will include extensive contacts with local schools and economic development groups. The findings will have significant implications for theories of sustainability and broad application to the many other systems where human communities depend on natural resources that are subject to the effects of those humans, and to external environmental changes.

Even in marine ecosystems, evidence has accumulated that many fisheries may not be sustainable. This lack of sustainability stems in part from the inability of the fish populations to generate enough surplus production to meet the expectations of the fisheries. In addition to this biotic dimension, however, there are equally important human dimensions, including regulations, investments in vessels and gear, locations of communities, property rights and fishing licenses, and other traditional and cultural aspects of fishing. Aquatic ecologists have described many aspects of the complexity of biotic systems that affect the productivity of fish populations, including diversity of phsical habitats, effects of changing environmental conditions, intra-specific competition, nutrient cycling, and community dynamics. These studies have not been adequately integrated, however, with work on the complexity of human systems, the commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries that are intimately and inextricably linked to the population dynamics of the fishes. The sockeye salmon fisheries in Bristol Bay, Alaska, present an ideal opportunity to understand the linkages between complex biotic and human systems, thereby extending basic understanding of these critical components of healthy human and natural communities. These fisheries, operating at commercial levels for a century, are among the best examples of sustainability, yet their complexity has only recently been investigated. Sockeye salmon breed in streams, ponds, rivers, and beaches associated with large lakes in five major drainage basins, and their offspring rear in the lakes for one or two years before migrating to sea for another two or three years. Tens of millions of these salmon return as adults each year, and fractions of the total are caught in mobile gillnet fisheries, fixed-site set net fisheries, recreational fisheries, and subsistence fisheries. Forecasts and in-season information are used by managers to decide on appropriate levels of fishing and by fishermen do decide where to fish. The forecasts are based on scientific information derived from research on climate-related and density-dependent processes governing the dynamics of the salmon populations. The primary concepts of interest in this interdisciplinary research project are the resilience of the biotic system (in this case, salmon abundance and diversity) to harvest and environmental change and the resilience of the human communities in the face of these changes in salmon abundance and associated changes in price and costs of fishing. The fundamental hypothesis is that the ability of the salmon populations to persist in the face of changing environmental conditions and the ability of the human communities to persist in the face of changing social and economic forces both depend on the diversity of ""life history"" strategies as well as a blend of site attachment and mobility.

The researchers plan to establish a general theoretical framework with linked circulation, population, habitat, and socioeconomic submodels. This structure will allow systematic exploration of several core questions, including: (1) what are the crucial cascades and feedbacks among physical, biological, and social systems that influence how reserve networks function? (2) What are the roles of different stakeholder groups, such as various fisher groups, local residents, tourists, etc, in this network function? and (3) how compatible are network systems based largely on criteria to promote local acceptability of reserves versus those more centrally optimized around biophysical criteria? In all questions, network function will be addressed through the effects on fisheries, biodiversity, and social/cultural systems.

This country, an archipelago of hundreds of island, is currently in the political process of expanding their set of marine protected areas (MPAs) into an interconnected network of marine reserves (to include up to 40 sites). Because of this, several Bahamas government and conservation agencies are welcoming scientific contributions to their policy-making discussions.

Previous scholarship focused on the gulf and other areas with low governance, enforcement, and monitoring capacity has often emphasized either ecological or institutional dynamics, but rarely integrates ecological, economic, and institutional analyses as proposed here. Through a combination of conceptual and quantitative modeling and field research, we are developing an innovative interdisciplinary approach for analyzing coupled natural and human coastal marine systems. Through these activities and associated interactions with other scientists and practitioners in the region, we are collecting substantial primary social, economic and ecological data to inform the development of quantitative models of human-environment linkages in the gulf, and contributing to the training of the next generation of sustainability science scholars. Well-functioning coastal and marine ecosystems provide a wide array of societal benefits, including food production, protection from coastal storms, and opportunities for recreation and tourism. Stewardship to ensure continued provision of these benefits requires understanding the connections between ecosystems and the people who live with them. Knowledge of the mechanisms underlying these interactions is vital for mitigation and adaptation to our changing world, particularly in the face of climate change. In this project, we focus on small-scale, or artisanal, fisheries in the Gulf of California, Mexico. To sustain fisheries in the gulf, a variety of management tools are under consideration, including marine reserves and other marine protected areas, catch shares, and territorial use rights. Moreover, the expected decentralization of fisheries management due to the recently amended Fisheries Law is anticipated to alter both ecological and socioeconomic dynamics within the region. Through the development of an interdisciplinary framework for understanding coastal marine environment-society connections, along with gulf-specific analyses, we will help inform development of innovative marine management strategies in this region and other coastal and marine areas worldwide.","Many benefits produced by healthy ecosystems are common pool resources, which create particular challenges for environmental policy and management.

The project will also improve knowledge and understanding among the broader community (middle school students, high school students, persons in youth and adult environmental education courses, and information personnel) about the nature, benefits, and risks of wildfire in the WUI. Research objectives of the project are to: (1) develop a wildfire-climate model called FIRECLIM that simulates the complex interactions among climate change, expansion of residential development into wildland areas, and wildfire risk in the WUI; (2) demonstrate how the FIRECLIM model can be used by local stakeholders to make optimal ex ante wildfire-related decisions under alternative climate change and economic growth scenarios for the next 50 years (2008 to 2058); (3) test several hypotheses about how future climate change, future residential expansion into wildland areas, and changes in land use policy are likely to influence future wildfires and future wildfire risk in the WUI; (4) develop an ex post decision framework that the community of interest can use to adaptively manage future wildfire risk in the WUI; and (5) construct a Web-based, interactive, spatial decision support tool that facilitates application of the ex ante and ex post decision frameworks by the community of interest. Educational objectives of the project are to: (1) train future practitioners and scientists in interdisciplinary modeling and analysis of a coupled natural-human system for managing future wildfire risk; (2) improve the capacity of the community of interest to assess and manage wildfire risk in the WUI under alternative climate change, economic growth futures, and land use policy futures; and (3) incorporate the research results into educational products that increase the broader community?s understanding and knowledge of wildfire and wildfire risk. The FIRECLIM model integrates a landscape fire dynamics simulation model, a structure ignition assessment model, agent-based behavioral models, and climate change and economic growth futures. We will establish and collaborate with four agent panels composed of representatives of the community of interest to identify alternative decisions for either minimizing net wildfire risk or maximizing expected return on investment in defensive fire measures. Our measure of net wildfire risk is somewhat unique because it accounts for both the expected losses and expected benefits of wildfires. We will evaluate how agents can adapt their wildfire-related decisions to future climate change and future expansion of residential development into wildland areas using an adaptive management framework that employs Bayesian statistical analysis for the risk case and the minimax regret criterion for the uncertainty case. Climate change futures will be based on IPCC scenarios, and residential development into wildland areas for alternative economic growth and land use policy futures will be simulated using the Ecosystem Landscape Modeling System. The project is the first study of its kind to assess how future climate change and future expansion of residential development into wildland areas influences wildfire and wildfire risk in the WUI. Dissemination of project results will be facilitated by incorporating research results into five products designed to improve the broader community?s knowledge and understanding of wildfire and wildfire risk management: (1) a decision support tool that facilitates adaptive management of future wildfire risk by the community of interest; (2) educational programs that enable the community of interest to learn about the interactions among wildfire risk, climate change, land use change, and economic development; (3) a new, one- to two-day, adult environmental education course on the role of wildfire in ecosystems; (4) an interactive, computer simulation program that allows users to interactively simulate wildfire-related decisions for alternative future changes in climate and economic growth in a hypothetical WUI; and (5) a book tentatively titled Managing Future Wildfire Risk in the Wildland-Urban Interface. In addition, the project will train future practitioners and scientists in ways to manage future wildfire risk and involve an international researcher and graduate student from Australia.

With few exceptions, fisheries currently are managed independently, ignoring important natural and human linkages among them. The biological productivity, sustainability, and consequently human benefits of complex fishery systems may be substantially increased if these linkages are better understood and if this understanding is applied to management. The American lobster (Homarus americanus), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and Northeast multispecies groundfish fisheries in the Gulf of Maine are of major ecological, economic, social, and cultural importance to the New England region. They are subject to an array of natural and human linkages that have not yet been systematically studied. This interdisciplinary research project will examine key natural and human linkages among these fisheries and integrate them into a quantitative framework, using numerical modeling to explore how improved understanding of complexity can improve sustainability and increase the flow of human benefits. An important component of the research is the translation of concepts and results into an educational program that will teach a new generation of students about the human and natural complexity of the Gulf of Maine ecosystem and create a sustained interest in marine science. The research is organized by themes. Theme 1 focuses on management of the coupled fishery system. Numerical models will be used to integrate research undertaken in themes 2,3, and 4 and to explore how information regarding interrelated natural and human processes can be used to improve management of these resources. Theme 2 will use econometric estimation and bioeconomic modeling to investigate the human connections between these fisheries that arise through movement of labor and capital between fisheries, regulatory interventions and markets for inputs and outputs, such as herring used as an input to lobster harvest. Theme 3 will synthesize and analyze existing data to characterize variability in transport and survival of early life stages to identify exogenous processes (especially climate-related processes) that drive variability in recruitment. Theme 4 will combine new field studies with analysis of existing data to examine the impact of natural and human-induced trophic interactions among lobster, herring, and groundfish on the population dynamics of these species. Theme 5 will focus on translating research findings into an interactive marine science education program, based at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, which serves fifth and sixth graders throughout the state of Maine. The project will make important contributions to science by improving basic understanding of the dynamic interrelationships of physical, ecological, and human-economic processes that determine the productivity and variability of the Gulf of Maine lobster, herring, and groundfish fisheries.

The research is organized by themes. Theme 1 focuses on management of the coupled fishery system. Numerical models will be used to integrate research undertaken in themes 2,3, and 4 and to explore how information regarding interrelated natural and human processes can be used to improve management of these resources. Theme 2 will use econometric estimation and bioeconomic modeling to investigate the human connections between these fisheries that arise through movement of labor and capital between fisheries, regulatory interventions and markets for inputs and outputs, such as herring used as an input to lobster harvest. Theme 3 will synthesize and analyze existing data to characterize variability in transport and survival of early life stages to identify exogenous processes (especially climate-related processes) that drive variability in recruitment. Theme 4 will combine new field studies with analysis of existing data to examine the impact of natural and human-induced trophic interactions among lobster, herring, and groundfish on the population dynamics of these species. Theme 5 will focus on translating research findings into an interactive marine science education program, based at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, which serves fifth and sixth graders throughout the state of Maine. The project will make important contributions to science by improving basic understanding of the dynamic interrelationships of physical, ecological, and human-economic processes that determine the productivity and variability of the Gulf of Maine lobster, herring, and groundfish fisheries. It also will help develop concepts, research methodologies, and models relevant to fishery systems around the world. There is general agreement on the need to take an ecosystem approach to managing fisheries, but little concrete progress has been made in doing so. This project will develop concepts and methodologies needed to implement an ecosystem approach to fishery management. The project brings together a team of researchers from a broad range of disciplines and will demonstrate the benefits of an integrated interdisciplinary approach to investigating natural-human systems. The research will develop new understanding and approaches for management of important Northeast U.S. fisheries. The new information and insights will be conveyed to fishery managers through seminars, participation in the management process, and publications. The research will be coordinated with an ongoing, interactive marine education activity. A broader goal of that education program is to increase the number of students pursuing education and informed careers in the sciences by generating interest and excitement about science at a critical age.

This sprawl has large impacts on natural and rural landscapes, ecosystem services, and quality of life for millions of people. This project investigates the processes linking dynamics of land-atmosphere carbon budgets in exurban residential areas, preferences for land-cover types and patterns on these lands, and land-management activities of residents and developers. The goal of the project is to obtain a clearer understanding of the relationships between carbon dynamics, land-management activities, and market and non-market values of land-uses and land-covers ? focusing on how carbon dynamics might respond in a non-linear fashion to various management and policy options for land-cover management. Building on the extensive data resources developed under a precursor project, the researchers will use dynamic agent-based models (including a new land-market sub model) to examine a range of exurban land-cover patterns that might be expected to result from market and policy drivers These models will be linked to homeowner preferences and landscape management behaviors from surveys. The outputs of the models will be coupled with a spatially explicit model of biogeochemistry, with inputs derived from remote sensing and field-based sampling within Southeastern Michigan. The researchers will explore the relationship between decision processes by various actors and the resulting changes in biogeochemical processes. We will look for the existence of ecologically significant thresholds (e.g., large, nonlinear land-atmosphere carbon exchange in response to small changes in policy, preferences or behaviors) that are revealed in the coupled system. The study will identify both modeled micro-level dynamics and macro-level patterns in space and time, building on data and model resources developed from previous projects, while creating a complementary new dataset to support modeling of land-market interactions that includes land transactions, biogeochemical processes, cultural preferences and management practices affecting land covers, The complex feedbacks explored in this project, that both drive and result from exurban sprawl, will provide new insights into how policy can be used to guide and manage this landscape change. Coupled computer models will be used to evaluate policy scenarios that may be spatially-targeted (e.g., zoning) or aspatial (e.g., carbon credits) and are designed to affect carbon dynamics through mechanisms built on an understanding of the incentives created by markets and preferences and behaviors of residents, developers, and local governments. Field and modeling work on soil and vegetation carbon dynamics will provide much needed insights into the effects of exurban development on carbon storage, which, given the growth of exurban development, has important implications for the atmospheric carbon budget. The project strengthens scientific capacity and integration by bringing together scientists from a wide range of fields including landscape architecture, ecosystem science, economics, geographic information science, and complex systems science. The project will produce results that improve our ability to model (a) carbon cycling in the heterogeneous landscapes that humans inhabit, (b) the economic incentives inherent in our management exurban landscapes, and (c) the linkages between peoples? preferences and their behaviors and ecological landscape function. Models developed for the project will be used to generate both formal and informal educational materials for both graduate and undergraduate instruction on environmental science, policy, and design, in order to improve student understanding of how complex coupled human-environment dynamics can complicate decision making about ecosystem services, and how spatial and dynamic modeling can improve our understanding of alternative options in such settings.","Exurban residential development is widespread, constituting one of the major forms of land-use and land-cover changes in the Eastern US and elsewhere.

The goal of the project is to obtain a clearer understanding of the relationships between carbon dynamics, land-management activities, and market and non-market values of land-uses and land-covers ? focusing on how carbon dynamics might respond in a non-linear fashion to various management and policy options for land-cover management. Building on the extensive data resources developed under a precursor project, the researchers will use dynamic agent-based models (including a new land-market sub model) to examine a range of exurban land-cover patterns that might be expected to result from market and policy drivers These models will be linked to homeowner preferences and landscape management behaviors from surveys. The outputs of the models will be coupled with a spatially explicit model of biogeochemistry, with inputs derived from remote sensing and field-based sampling within Southeastern Michigan. The researchers will explore the relationship between decision processes by various actors and the resulting changes in biogeochemical processes. We will look for the existence of ecologically significant thresholds (e.g., large, nonlinear land-atmosphere carbon exchange in response to small changes in policy, preferences or behaviors) that are revealed in the coupled system. The study will identify both modeled micro-level dynamics and macro-level patterns in space and time, building on data and model resources developed from previous projects, while creating a complementary new dataset to support modeling of land-market interactions that includes land transactions, biogeochemical processes, cultural preferences and management practices affecting land covers, The complex feedbacks explored in this project, that both drive and result from exurban sprawl, will provide new insights into how policy can be used to guide and manage this landscape change. Coupled computer models will be used to evaluate policy scenarios that may be spatially-targeted (e.g., zoning) or aspatial (e.g., carbon credits) and are designed to affect carbon dynamics through mechanisms built on an understanding of the incentives created by markets and preferences and behaviors of residents, developers, and local governments. Field and modeling work on soil and vegetation carbon dynamics will provide much needed insights into the effects of exurban development on carbon storage, which, given the growth of exurban development, has important implications for the atmospheric carbon budget. The project strengthens scientific capacity and integration by bringing together scientists from a wide range of fields including landscape architecture, ecosystem science, economics, geographic information science, and complex systems science. The project will produce results that improve our ability to model (a) carbon cycling in the heterogeneous landscapes that humans inhabit, (b) the economic incentives inherent in our management exurban landscapes, and (c) the linkages between peoples? preferences and their behaviors and ecological landscape function. Models developed for the project will be used to generate both formal and informal educational materials for both graduate and undergraduate instruction on environmental science, policy, and design, in order to improve student understanding of how complex coupled human-environment dynamics can complicate decision making about ecosystem services, and how spatial and dynamic modeling can improve our understanding of alternative options in such settings.",1488805,USD,1488805,9/1/2008,2008,8/31/2014,2014,DANIEL BROWN; Rick Riolo; Scott Page; William Currie; Joan Nassauer,University of Michigan,University of Michigan; University of Michigan; University of Michigan; University of Michigan; University of Michigan,grid.214458.e; grid.214458.e; grid.214458.e; grid.214458.e; grid.214458.e,United States; United States; United States; United States; United States,Directorate for Geosciences,http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0814542&HistoricalAwards=false,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.3089925,1402 Applied Economics; 0501 Ecological Applications; 0502 Environmental Science and Management,1402 Applied Economics,0501 Ecological Applications,0502 Environmental Science and Management,,,

This work integrates social and ecological sciences to study a fire-prone landscape in central Oregon that includes private, state, federal, and tribal lands. Our method will combine an established spatially explicit, policy-driven, multiagent model of land management decision-making, models of vegetative succession and fire ignition/spread that can represent climate change effects, and a suite of landscape evaluators of socio-economic and ecological system performance. The project will integrate existing studies of ecosystems with new and ongoing studies characterizing human preferences and values in these landscapes to parameterize the multiagent model with defensible representations of human decision-making. We will extend the application of agent-based models to study how social networks influence landscape dynamics and adaptation, and explore landscape trajectories under alternative policy and climate change scenarios using Monte Carlo techniques to understand variant/invariant aspects of landscape change, land management policy strategies, human preferences, and ecosystem feedbacks. These analyses will help identify management strategies that increase adaptive capacity of these landscapes to respond to uncertain futures. We anticipate this project will: 1) reveal complex system behaviors associated with fire-prone landscapes, 2) improve effectiveness of forest management policies in multiownership fire-prone landscapes, 3) improve understanding of the role of social networks (e.g. fire protection districts and environmental organizations) and economic forces in influencing how landowners and managers make decisions under risk and uncertainty, and 4) improve understanding of how external forces of climate change and carbon markets could affect policy outcomes, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Wildland fire policies in the U.S. are fragmented and broken, largely because land and wildfire management policies do not fully consider human and ecological effects. Typically, the fire-prone landscape is divided into a ""wildland-urban interface"" under the influence of fire management agencies, and a wild landscape under the influence of land managers. These two fire worlds are often seen as socially, economically, and organizationally separate, yet they are clearly part of a single interconnected landscape. Lack of understanding of these connections has lead to policies that are ineffective or even counterproductive. For example, fire suppression can increase the severity of fires and draws resources away from necessary ecological restoration work in wilder parts of the landscape. The problem of adaptation to fire-prone landscapes is even more challenging when climate change and carbon markets are considered. In order to develop more effective policies, we need to improve our understanding of how social systems - networks and institutions - influence behavior in private and public landowners.

These informal arrangements and incentives are important because they help us understand the extent to which private interests might strengthen or weaken on-going resource management and, consequently, the sustainability of coupled human and natural systems. The broad hypothesis driving the study is that the informal social structure that emerges from competitive interactions among fishermen reflects the particular circumstances of the natural system. In some cases, successful competition requires secretive non-cooperative behavior; in others, cooperation tends to yield better competitive results. These different outcomes have different, and not always obvious, impacts on the feasibility and effectiveness of resource management. We think of the relevant human social process as one in which individuals compete with one another through time-consuming and costly acquisition of valuable knowledge about a complex resource. To compete successfully, individuals must balance the immediate benefits that come from exploiting knowledge they currently hold with the costly need to explore for new knowledge; additionally, when seeking new knowledge, individuals must balance the costs and benefits of acquiring knowledge through cooperation or through autonomous search. In order to model this kind of competitive process, we employ a significantly modified version of a technique borrowed from computer science called a learning classifier system (LCS). LCS uses a genetic algorithm to mimic the way an agent (here a fisherman) uses his experience to continuously refine his knowledge and decisions about his natural and social environment. The importance of LCS is that it permits simulation of the co-evolving strategic interactions of self-interested fishermen who are only partially informed about the state of the resource they are exploiting and the fishermen with whom they compete. The problem of understanding these kinds of competitive dynamics is evident in almost all coupled natural and human systems. We apply the approach to a comparative study of three Gulf of Maine fisheries which are characterized by significantly different temporal and spatial dynamics - sea urchins, lobster and cod. Each fishery will be modeled using a biophysical simulator of the natural system and a tightly integrated multi-agent learning classifier system that simulates the learning and interactions of fishermen. The design of each model will be based in part on extensive interviews with fishermen about their knowledge of the dynamics of the fisheries in which they work. We will use these models to explore past and prospective policy problems in each fishery. Beyond the immediate applicability of these explorations, we expect this project will provide a foundation for the wider use of multi-agent learning models in other coupled systems. Project outcomes will be transmitted regularly to industry and managers. Principal investigators include economists, biologists, anthropologists and computer scientists. All the PIs have years of experience in the fisheries of the Gulf of Maine and have well developed relationships with individual fishermen and managers.

These informal arrangements and incentives are important because they help us understand the extent to which private interests might strengthen or weaken on-going resource management and, consequently, the sustainability of coupled human and natural systems. The broad hypothesis driving the study is that the informal social structure that emerges from competitive interactions among fishermen reflects the particular circumstances of the natural system. In some cases, successful competition requires secretive non-cooperative behavior; in others, cooperation tends to yield better competitive results. These different outcomes have different, and not always obvious, impacts on the feasibility and effectiveness of resource management. We think of the relevant human social process as one in which individuals compete with one another through time-consuming and costly acquisition of valuable knowledge about a complex resource. To compete successfully, individuals must balance the immediate benefits that come from exploiting knowledge they currently hold with the costly need to explore for new knowledge; additionally, when seeking new knowledge, individuals must balance the costs and benefits of acquiring knowledge through cooperation or through autonomous search. In order to model this kind of competitive process, we employ a significantly modified version of a technique borrowed from computer science called a learning classifier system (LCS). LCS uses a genetic algorithm to mimic the way an agent (here a fisherman) uses his experience to continuously refine his knowledge and decisions about his natural and social environment. The importance of LCS is that it permits simulation of the co-evolving strategic interactions of self-interested fishermen who are only partially informed about the state of the resource they are exploiting and the fishermen with whom they compete. The problem of understanding these kinds of competitive dynamics is evident in almost all coupled natural and human systems. We apply the approach to a comparative study of three Gulf of Maine fisheries which are characterized by significantly different temporal and spatial dynamics - sea urchins, lobster and cod. Each fishery will be modeled using a biophysical simulator of the natural system and a tightly integrated multi-agent learning classifier system that simulates the learning and interactions of fishermen. The design of each model will be based in part on extensive interviews with fishermen about their knowledge of the dynamics of the fisheries in which they work. We will use these models to explore past and prospective policy problems in each fishery. Beyond the immediate applicability of these explorations, we expect this project will provide a foundation for the wider use of multi-agent learning models in other coupled systems. Project outcomes will be transmitted regularly to industry and managers. Principal investigators include economists, biologists, anthropologists and computer scientists. All the PIs have years of experience in the fisheries of the Gulf of Maine and have well developed relationships with individual fishermen and managers. A masters level student in marine policy, a Ph.D. student in computer or marine science and a post-doctoral researcher in computer science will be employed on the project.

We hypothesize that the combined effects of climate variability and changes made by humans to their local environment can influence key aspects of both mosquito ecology and human behavior. Studying this system as a whole will improve our ability to predict risks of mosquito vector and dengue virus exposure and the possible impacts of future climate change. Dengue viruses circulate between mosquitoes and humans, causing an estimated 100 million human dengue infections annually. In the last decade, the Americas have experienced a dramatic increase in severe cases (dengue hemorrhagic fever), with devastating public health consequences. As neither vaccines nor therapeutics are yet available, mosquito control is the main option for preventing and controlling dengue outbreaks. Efforts in this area have been hindered by a poor understanding of the dengue virus transmission system at the interface between its natural and human components. Of particular concern is the potential for dengue fever to expand into areas that are presently outside transmission zones but may become vulnerable under scenarios of future climate change. For example, this potential expansion poses a risk to the ~19 million people in and near Mexico City, a high altitude ""island"" currently free of dengue but surrounded by dengue virus transmission at lower altitudes. Specific aims of the project are to: (1) determine how weather/climate factors are related to the presence and abundance of disease-carrying mosquitoes, especially by serving as barriers to mosquitoes becoming established in an area; (2) use these results in high-resolution atmospheric models to develop a predictive model for future mosquito range expansion; (3) determine which aspects of human behavior and attributes of man-made environments are most closely related to Ae. aegypti presence and abundance; (4) employ state-of-the-science data assimilation procedures to validate, refine, and define uncertainty in this modeling framework. Key aspects of this coupled natural and human system will be studied along an altitudinal transect in Mexico, ranging from coastal, low-elevation environments with well established vector mosquito populations and intense dengue virus transmission to high-elevation, mountainous areas which currently are free of the mosquito vector and local virus transmission. The team of experts from Mexico and the United States includes climatologists, vector ecologists, modelers and medical anthropologists. The project will contribute essential insights into the ongoing debate about climate change and infectious disease relationships, extending beyond the explicit vector ecology and geographic boundaries of this study. The work will provide quantitative knowledge that can be used to develop novel strategies to control Ae. aegypti in the face of future threats to system resilience. Further, it will provide training for a postdoctoral fellow in climate modeling and spatial risk modeling at both Colorado State University and the National Center for Atmospheric Research and involvement and in situ training of university and secondary school students in data collection. Through ""participatory epidemiology"", local community members will learn how to use environmental observation and data collection as a means of community empowerment.","This project will explore the ecology of Aedes (Ae.) aegypti, the mosquito that transmits dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya.

Models developed for the project will be used to generate both formal and informal educational materials for both graduate and undergraduate instruction on environmental science, policy, and design, in order to improve student understanding of how complex coupled human-environment dynamics can complicate decision making about ecosystem services, and how spatial and dynamic modeling can improve our understanding of alternative options in such settings.",7554,USD,7554,9/1/2008,2008,8/31/2009,2009,Dawn Parker,George Mason University,George Mason University,grid.22448.38,United States,Directorate for Geosciences,http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0813799&HistoricalAwards=false,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.2996608,1402 Applied Economics; 0501 Ecological Applications; 0502 Environmental Science and Management,1402 Applied Economics,0501 Ecological Applications,0502 Environmental Science and Management,,,

The consequences of these intensified interactions and the actions that society could take to affect their course remain largely unknown. To address this gap, the nature and types of behaviors that result when humans and landscapes closely interact will be investigated with an integrated program of numerical model development, model testing, individualized and classroom instruction and public outreach for two specific cases: barrier island resorts, such as on the US east coast, and mountainous urban-wildland interfaces, such as on the margins of Los Angeles. Numerical models will be developed that include representations of both the behavior of economic and management actors and the ways in which landscapes respond to natural processes and human influence. Significant effort will be devoted to communicating the results and implications to other researchers, students, policy managers and the general public. Barrier islands are low-lying strips of sand that are parallel to and separated from the mainland coast by lagoons, cut by inlets, and topped by sand dunes; they are popular vacation destinations. Barrier islands are modeled by tracking changes to their shape and volume from: beach erosion and deposition owing to storms and waves. The economics of resorts are modeled using two markets: a hotel building/buying/selling market, which connects profit-maximizing developers and hotel owners; and a tourism market, which connects hotel owners with tourists seeking the best vacation experience for their money. Managers in the model widen the beach and build up dunes to protect against storms and enhance beach quality. The model will be tested against historical measurements from the US east coast and will be used to explore how barrier island resorts respond to rising sea level and increased storminess resulting from global climate change. The margins of mountain catchments offer attractive residential attributes, but development is subject to an array of significant hazards. In the model being developed for the urban-wildland boundary zone, shrubland vegetation grows between fires; wildfires consume vegetation and residences and promote erosion; landslides, floods and sediment-laden debris flows damage or destroy residences; developers build housing developments whose size and location are based on projected profits; and residents buy houses based on projected appreciation and attributes such as view and commute distance. Managers in the model approve developments; mitigate fires with prescribed burns; mitigate landslides, floods and debris flows with slope stabilization, debris basins, reservoirs and channel stabilization and entrenchment; and suppress fires. Historical data on fires, floods and urban expansion in Los Angeles will be used to test the model, and the effect of urbanization on fire size and frequency and the long-term change through space and time of the urban-wildland boundary under differing management strategies will be investigated. This research bears directly on societally relevant problems and policy decisions associated with human encroachment on the natural environment and disaster management. Its broader impact will include individualized and classroom instruction, meetings with coastal managers and public outreach.

The investigator team will build an Earth System Model (EaSM) that couples multi-scale ocean, atmosphere, watershed, biogeochemistry and human system models. The projected variability of the coupled environmental and human systems, represented with bio-economic and social network models, will be used to study management and other socio-economic decisions affecting future sustainable practices and the long-term evolution of the Earth System. The target for this study is the northeast U.S., a highly urbanized and densely populated region with approximately 33% of the US population hosting one the world's largest economies. It is also a region where vulnerability to global change is heightened, experiencing significant climate and ecosystem changes, shifting land use, and a complex western boundary current oceanic regime with significant implications to the northern hemisphere climate. Since many of the global change issues can be attributed to anthropogenic perturbations (e.g., a warming climate, ecosystem stress, declining biodiversity) the interface of the physical environment with human systems is central to this project. Intellectual merit: This project will use disciplinary and computational developments of the last 20 years to assemble, test and use an Earth System Model. The proposed model emerges from the realization that humans and their political, economic and social structures are an integral part of the Earth System dynamically interacting with its climate and ecosystems. Therefore, the ultimate goal of the proposed model is to be able to study present and future climate and ecosystems, accounting for both physical and anthropogenic forcings and the relevant human decision-making structures. To that end, this project aims to increase the skill of contemporary climate models by implementing a strategy that permits multi-scale interactions in the physics and biogeochemistry, improving upon known biases in the models and where necessary improve the dimensional representation of the physics and the ecosystems (e.g., the land-sea boundary). Broader impacts: The project aims to develop tools that can be used to study and address some of the biggest long-term challenges facing humans namely, a changing climate and limited natural resources. It achieves this first, by addressing known deficiencies in global climate model and second, by developing a model that includes economics and the human impact on the climate system. The target region for the study is the northeast U.S. and adjacent coastal ocean. This is a region with a significant population size and economic activity, which are particularly vulnerable to climate change. However, all the components of the proposed Earth System Model can be implemented in any region of interest. The resulting model will be available both to scientists for research purposes and to policy makers as a decision support tool. The framework for the model development is the community-based NCAR-Community Climate System Model. As such all development becomes part of the scientific community repository with significant technical support, education and outreach infrastructure. A significant outreach activity proposed is to hold a workshop for scientists and policy people with the main goal of teaching potential users of the model its capabilities with hands on tutorials, and particular examples developed during this work. This proposal will also support students and post-doctoral fellows during various stages of the work. Finally, this work brings together scientific communities that do not typically work together. The challenges facing society due to a changing climate, population growth and resource limitations are multi-faceted and it will take an interdisciplinary approach to study, mitigate and solve them. Arguably, the biggest impact of this work is the assembly of scientists with varied interests and disciplines ready to work towards a common goal.","A unified framework for studying global change in the Earth System allowing for scale interactions (up/down-scaling) and explicitly modeled dynamic feedbacks between the sub-components will be developed.

A significant outreach activity proposed is to hold a workshop for scientists and policy people with the main goal of teaching potential users of the model its capabilities with hands on tutorials, and particular examples developed during this work. This proposal will also support students and post-doctoral fellows during various stages of the work. Finally, this work brings together scientific communities that do not typically work together. The challenges facing society due to a changing climate, population growth and resource limitations are multi-faceted and it will take an interdisciplinary approach to study, mitigate and solve them.

A significant portion of these increased flows will pass through stormwater and wastewater infrastructures thus impacting ecosystem functions and potentially affecting public health. Increased flows are also likely to exacerbate water quality problems associated with flooding, point and non-point pollution, and the quality of ecosystems, drinking water sources and recreational water throughout the state. Urban and rural water systems are at the interface between these increased flows and the response of the human system and economy. This project addresses how urban and rural water systems adapt to environmental changes and how these adaptations affect water quality, health and economic opportunities. In particular, the focus is on wastewater and storm /sewer infrastructure and technology as well as governance systems and conflicts that arise in complex watersheds. These issues are being addressed in two contrasting watersheds, the Grand River and the Lake St. Clair, that capture the diversity of the state?s water resources and issues. As financial decisions can be made at the state, county or often local level for wastewater, storm water and drinking water, it is important that research address these scales of interaction and decision making when addressing governance and water. A road map for conducting research to better understand future risk to water quality and health in these watersheds is being developed, resulting in a series of published papers. These products are addressing possible adaptations, mitigations and potential opportunities under a 'blue economy' and future climate change. Information on data needs and sources as well as on models, tools and techniques are being gathered via a series of 1 day workshops focusing on seven areas associated with the community capital framework (CCF). The seven focus areas are: human capital addressing knowledge, skills and abilities of people; social capital including networks of trust and relationships; political capital capturing relationships between the public and political organizations; cultural capital addressing the state and world view; financial capital and funds available for investment in the future; built capital including water infrastructure and technology; and natural capital which includes ecosystems, ecosystem services and human habitat (eg beaches, parks). The CCF allows for the development of research designs that integrate the social, economic, infrastructural, and natural factors in assessing the effects of climate change on these watersheds. The team includes faculty and graduate students and is engaging the public, particularly Native American stakeholders, government officials, and relevant industries. Because of the cross-boundary nature of the water issues in the region, international participation from Canada is included. A unique community captial framework is being develop that integrates the seven capitals under multiple scenarios of future climate change to improve the understanding of the complex nature of coupled human and aquatic systems and assist with decision making. Water is a critical component of national concerns regarding climate change and energy. Given that freshwater systems will undoubtedly play a critical role in a looming water crisis, the lessons from the Great Lakes transboundary region, and particularly from a freshwater-rich state such as Michigan, can assist in understanding and addressing future water and health problems nationally and internationally. In addition, the large expense of re-investing in water and wastewater infrastructure to prevent pollution of water resources is a significant challenge. Coupling the intellectual, entrepreneurial, and organizational expertise of universities, businesses and government will facilitate the development of the best practices for water science, technology, and education such that problems become opportunities.

At one extreme, some cities are developing dedicated and integrated climate adaptation plans. At the other extreme are cities that have not established any plans or initiated any adaptation measures whatsoever. Drawing on theories of diffusion and capacity, and case study and survey methodologies, this comparative international research examines: (1) the types of plans for climate adaptation being adopted in cities; (2) factors associated with differences in the approaches urban municipalities are taking toward climate adaptation planning; and (3) the ways that the efforts of nongovernmental and community-based organizations complement, circumvent, and replace government adaptation initiatives. The results from this inquiry will expand our understanding of the forces and factors shaping decisions related to urban climate action. They also will deepen our knowledge of how civil society actors affect the capacity local governments. Disaster risk reduction is a critical component of climate adaptation planning. Therefore, as a consequence of studying adaptation, this research will enhance our understanding of the social and political dimensions of planning for natural disasters. To ensure that the policy-relevant results reach decision-makers in cities, the findings will be summarized in a report and disseminated to members of climate and local government networks. The research findings also will form the basis for case studies that can be used in graduate-level courses and will contribute to the development of a web tool designed to assist cities in their adaptation initiatives.

The focus of LSU's effort will be on two of the most catastrophic and unique aspects of this storm: (1) the terrible loss of life due to storm surge, and (2) the damage and destruction of numerous short- and medium-span bridges due to surge and waves. The first task concerns collection of perishable data about flood casualties. Previous research has documented a strong relationship between fatality rates and depth of flooding, but the effects of other variables are less well understood. Detailed data will be collected about the conditions surrounding fatalities, including: (1) location (GPS coordinates); (2) depth of water; (3) where the fatality occurred, e.g., building, car, in open space; (4) building type, elevation, number of stories, and damage sustained (if fatality occurred in a building); and (5) demographic data.

Such models are valuable to emergency managers and disaster public health officials to aid in disaster planning, design of mitigation measures, search and rescue operations, and recovery operations. The second task in this award will be concerned with collecting bridge damage data. It will focus on short- and medium-span bridges that have performed poorly during Hurricane Katrina and last year during Hurricane Ivan.

The collected bridge data will be used to develop design solutions for new construction of coastal bridges and rehabilitation of existing coastal bridges to avoid the occurrence of similar tragedies. Collected data from both tasks will be assembled into a report along with results from other AAWE partner investigations, which will be the subject of a one-day workshop held in Washington, DC, with financial and administrative support from the American Society of Civil Engineers' Structural Engineering Institute.

This integrated international research program combines hydrological, geochemical, and geophysical measurements in the seasonal tropics including in situ data collection and analysis, enhanced by the use of natural and introduced tracers and modeling. The overall objective of this collaborative research program is to understand important runoff generating processes in the seasonal tropics and the roles of seasonal transitions and land-use changes on runoff mechanism thresholds. Hydrologic, geochemical and isotopic data collected over a range of scales will compare the virtually pristine 414 km2 old-growth Upper Rio Chagres and adjacent 330 km2 largely deforested Rio Pacora watersheds to examine land-use change effects. Different bedrock types underlay these basins, so geochemistry and isotopes will be used to assist in identifying flow paths and residence times and in model and hypothesis testing. The humid tropics cover 22% of the Earth's land surface and are home to 36% of humanity. The selected study area is representative of the humid tropics promoting transferability of the knowledge gained to a geographically large region.

This integrated international research program combines hydrological, geochemical, and geophysical measurements in the seasonal tropics including in situ data collection and analysis, enhanced by the use of natural and introduced tracers and modeling. The overall objective of this collaborative research program is to understand important runoff generating processes in the seasonal tropics and the roles of seasonal transitions and land-use changes on runoff mechanism thresholds. Hydrologic, geochemical and isotopic data collected over a range of scales will compare the virtually pristine 414 km2 old-growth Upper Rio Chagres and adjacent 330 km2 largely deforested Rio Pacora watersheds to examine land-use change effects. Different bedrock types underlay these basins, so geochemistry and isotopes will be used to assist in identifying flow paths and residence times and in model and hypothesis testing. The humid tropics cover 22% of the Earth's land surface and are home to 36% of humanity. The selected study area is representative of the humid tropics promoting transferability of the knowledge gained to a geographically large region.

They closely interact and affect each other in many ways. Study of Human-Hydrological relationships is one key common interest for the NSF ARCSS and HARC programs. Recently, both programs have identified the Arctic Human-Hydrological Relationship as a major research gap, and both recommend more research efforts to characterize this relationship across sectors of human activity and Arctic regions. Currently this relationship has been explored in only a few cases that mainly investigate how Arctic hydrologic changes influence northern society and culture. It is, however, important to note that the study of human impacts on the arctic hydrologic system is also a great challenge and is a major research gap in the ARCSS programs. While various human activities -- such as water use for industry and irrigation, and change of land use and land cover -- affect hydrology regimes, construction and operation of large dams and reservoirs make the most significant changes in regional-global hydrology systems. Many large dams and reservoirs have been constructed mainly for flood control and hydropower generation in the northern regions/watersheds, and their operation substantially alters river streamflow, sediment and thermal conditions. Large dams directly and significantly regulate streamflow; they change monthly and seasonal discharge regimes over space and time, and they affect yearly streamflow characteristics at the basin scale. It is important to note that, relative to climatic effects, dam impacts are much more direct and often cause abrupt changes in regional hydrologic regimes, thus significantly affecting long-term trends, especially at seasonal and regional scales. Recent analyses of hydrologic changes in large Siberian Rivers demonstrate that, due to reservoir regulation, discharge records collected at the basin outlet do not always represent natural changes and variations; these records tend to underestimate the natural runoff trends in summer and overestimate trends for winter and autumn. There is a need to document and understand to what extent large dams affect arctic hydrology changes. The PI's research will specifically seek to quantify how large reservoirs impact Siberian regional hydrologic changes. In addition, they will synthesize regional analyses from Canada, Nordic countries and Siberia to achieve a comprehensive pan-Arctic assessment of dam effect on the arctic hydrology system and its past change.

It combines future climate projections, remote sensing and hydrological data together with hydrological, geophysical, agroecosystem and economic modeling to characterize the relative importance of local precipitation, runoff, groundwater mining, interbasin water transfers, and agricultural and non-agricultural water use for the region's water supply-demand balance. The project goal is to estimate how effects of climate change on high-elevation snow, ice, and permafrost hydrology will affect downstream water resources and food production, and through scenario analyses with regard to e.g. dam construction and other large-scale water engineering efforts. The project is assessing current and projected water resources in the watersheds of the major rivers draining from the Asian High Mountains (principally the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Salween, Mekong, Yangtze, Yellow, Amu Darya, Syr Darya, and Irtysh Rivers), with a particular focus on the climatic change and variability impacts on runoff from the highlands. Irrigated agriculture is widespread in the study region, and water resources are tightly linked to food supplies. Agricultural economies support the majority of the regional population, so water and food resources are a key factor in the regional economy. This project is linking water supply and potential food production to an economic model, enabling assessment of water use, cropping intensity and yields in each of the various crop production sectors of the economy. The project is characterizing the response of downstream water demand and agricultural production to increased population, economic activity expansion and constrained water supplies, and assessing the implications of improvements in irrigation and crop water use efficiency, proposed major interbasin water transfer projects and dam construction, and deep groundwater depletion for food security and trade in the region's economies. Simulation uncertainties are assessed by sensitivity analyses driven by uncertainties in both model parameters and agricultural and hydrological databases. The project has collaborative ties with researchers in several countries in the study region, and they are contributing to efforts to obtain relevant data on regional land and water use. Water and food security in Asia in the face of climate change and rising populations is an issue of global importance. Much of the study region is already experiencing physical or economic water scarcity, and major water engineering works are planned in both India and China. This broadly interdisciplinary project (geosciences, agricultural sciences, social sciences) is quantifying contemporary water resources, water use for agriculture, and food production, and the economic consequences of future climate change on water and food prices in the study region. Knowledge gained in this study will improve the capacity of integrated assessment modeling to account for the physical constraints of water resources on future economic and social activity, and mitigation and adaptation strategies. This project includes graduate student education & training and undergraduate research opportunities.

It combines future climate projections, remote sensing and hydrological data together with hydrological, geophysical, agroecosystem and economic modeling to characterize the relative importance of local precipitation, runoff, groundwater mining, interbasin water transfers, and agricultural and non-agricultural water use for the region's water supply-demand balance. The project goal is to estimate how effects of climate change on high-elevation snow, ice, and permafrost hydrology will affect downstream water resources and food production, and through scenario analyses with regard to e.g. dam construction and other large-scale water engineering efforts. The project is assessing current and projected water resources in the watersheds of the major rivers draining from the Asian High Mountains (principally the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Salween, Mekong, Yangtze, Yellow, Amu Darya, Syr Darya, and Irtysh Rivers), with a particular focus on the climatic change and variability impacts on runoff from the highlands. Irrigated agriculture is widespread in the study region, and water resources are tightly linked to food supplies. Agricultural economies support the majority of the regional population, so water and food resources are a key factor in the regional economy. This project is linking water supply and potential food production to an economic model, enabling assessment of water use, cropping intensity and yields in each of the various crop production sectors of the economy. The project is characterizing the response of downstream water demand and agricultural production to increased population, economic activity expansion and constrained water supplies, and assessing the implications of improvements in irrigation and crop water use efficiency, proposed major interbasin water transfer projects and dam construction, and deep groundwater depletion for food security and trade in the region's economies. Simulation uncertainties are assessed by sensitivity analyses driven by uncertainties in both model parameters and agricultural and hydrological databases.

What is the relative role of local hydrologic conditions, such as location within a watershed and depth to the groundwater table, in shaping the water pools? Can we predict the response of these water pools to seasonal, inter-annual, and longer term climate variability in Africa? What is the impact of land use change on the spatial coverage and persistence of these water pools? A specific set of hypotheses will be studied with emphasis on the followings: (i) A significant fraction of the variation in mosquito abundance between villages can be explained by variation in the location of groundwater table relative to the surface; (ii) Land use change in the Sahel and the associated degradation of vegetation and soil will result in increasing the fractional spatial coverage and the persistence of mosquito breeding habitats; and (iii) Adult mosquito abundance can be predicted using satellite observations of rainfall over the Sahel.

Domestic and international conservation projects conducted in highland watersheds of this region have historically focused on the agricultural practices of ethnic minority (hill tribe) groups. While improper cultivation techniques on steep slopes are certainly responsible for serious downstream effects in some areas, expansion of the rural road network may be equally or more important. To advance scientific understanding of the impacts of roads on regional hydrology, they must be studied at the watershed scale, within the context of other hydrologically important land-cover changes.

The objective of the proposed study is to investigate the roles of, and the interaction between, roads and nonroad land surfaces in altering watershed functions and accelerating soil erosion in areas undergoing tropical deforestation.

To study the hydrologic and sediment fluxes measured in PKEW, we will couple sediment detachment and routing equations with equations describing surface flow in DHSVM. The adapted model will help us to determine the sources of overland flow and transported sediment, and to study where these fluxes are redistributed with PKEW, or transported from the basin. We will finally use the model to quantify watershed impacts resulting from the emergence of roads and the expansion of agriculture on steeply sloping lands within PKEW over the last 50 years.

This workshop builds on previous New Directions efforts to promote the integration of ethics and values concerns with scientific and technical knowledge to address pressing societal issues. This workshop will focus on the environmental and societal challenges surrounding New Orleans/Mississippi Delta in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Responding to the devastation followed by Katrina requires an appreciation of the interrelated perspectives of various fields, such as geology, hydrology, historical geography, ecology, economics, history, ethics, urban planning, policy, cultural analysis, and a host of other disciplines. This workshop will provide a forum to explore how to improve communication and integration across these fields. How do we identify and integrate the pertinent knowledge necessary for addressing this catastrophe, as well as for anticipating and responding to similar possibilities in the future? Each day's session will be structured around two or three themes, where specialists will give presentations on relevant topics, which will then be treated as catalysts for interdisciplinary discussion on the two overarching themes of the workshop. The intellectual merit of this project is that it will deepen our understanding of the interconnections between disciplines in addressing societal challenges. The natural sciences and engineering are good at providing knowledge about the physical world. The social sciences and humanities are good at providing knowledge of the social world. But as Katrina's devastation has demonstrated, we must also understand the intersection between things and people: between the natural environment, science and engineering, and social orders. The broader impact of this proposal lies in its potential for improving the relevance of scientific and engineering knowledge to the social realm. Results from this workshop will include publications and course development using New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta as means for exploring the importance of interdisciplinary research in order to properly respond to crises like Katrina. Less standard deliverables will include the creation of new partnerships between academia, decision makers, and the public at large.

This workshop will focus on the environmental and societal challenges surrounding New Orleans/Mississippi Delta in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Responding to the devastation followed by Katrina requires an appreciation of the interrelated perspectives of various fields, such as geology, hydrology, historical geography, ecology, economics, history, ethics, urban planning, policy, cultural analysis, and a host of other disciplines. This workshop will provide a forum to explore how to improve communication and integration across these fields. How do we identify and integrate the pertinent knowledge necessary for addressing this catastrophe, as well as for anticipating and responding to similar possibilities in the future? Each day's session will be structured around two or three themes, where specialists will give presentations on relevant topics, which will then be treated as catalysts for interdisciplinary discussion on the two overarching themes of the workshop. The intellectual merit of this project is that it will deepen our understanding of the interconnections between disciplines in addressing societal challenges. The natural sciences and engineering are good at providing knowledge about the physical world. The social sciences and humanities are good at providing knowledge of the social world. But as Katrina's devastation has demonstrated, we must also understand the intersection between things and people: between the natural environment, science and engineering, and social orders. The broader impact of this proposal lies in its potential for improving the relevance of scientific and engineering knowledge to the social realm. Results from this workshop will include publications and course development using New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta as means for exploring the importance of interdisciplinary research in order to properly respond to crises like Katrina. Less standard deliverables will include the creation of new partnerships between academia, decision makers, and the public at large. Workshop and related materials will also be collected on the web for use by science, engineering, social science, humanities, policy classes, decision-makers, and the public to further interdisciplinary problem solving.",48434,USD,48434,11/15/2005,2005,10/31/2006,2006,Robert Frodeman; Victor Baker; Craig Colten; Irene Klaver; Susan Rachel May,University of North Texas,University of North Texas; University of North Texas; University of North Texas; University of North Texas; University of North Texas,grid.266869.5; grid.266869.5; grid.266869.5; grid.266869.5; grid.266869.5,United States; United States; United States; United States; United States,Directorate for Geosciences,http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0555035&HistoricalAwards=false,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.3065451,1605 Policy and Administration,1605 Policy and Administration,,,,,

Water prevents or promotes access to food or shelter. Water has always been and will always be integral to the culture of humans in the Arctic. In the past 30 years, the climate in the Arctic has warmed appreciably and there is evidence for a significant polar amplification of global warming in the future. Recent studies suggest that climate change will have a significant impact on arctic hydrology. Changes in the hydrologic cycle will affect both the presence of surface water and the thermal balance in soil. While preliminary evidence suggests a changing climate will have a significant impact on the hydrologic cycle in arctic regions, very little evidence is available to predict how the quality and quantity of freshwater available to humans is likely to change. Even less is understood about how hydrologic changes will affect the health, sustainability, and culture of humans in the Arctic. The overall objective of the proposed research is to understand the vital role of freshwater in the lives of humans in the Arctic, how it has changed in the recent past, and how it is likely to change in the future. This work will build a model that will allow us to predict climate-induced changes in the hydrologic cycle and their effects on water quality and availability. On the basis of this data, it will attempt to understand how these changes will impact the life and culture of Arctic peoples. This study will take place on the Seward Peninsula, where climate-induced changes in the hydrologic cycle are already apparent. Although the Seward Peninsula is south of the Arctic Circle, it is a very good analogue for a warmer Arctic. It is predominantly underlain by continuous permafrost in the northern and central peninsula and the predominant vegetation is tussock tundra. This project will draw upon community interaction, historical documentation, field observations, laboratory experimentation, and computer modeling. The PIs have extensive experience conducting research on the Seward Peninsula, working both in the physical and social sciences. The broader impact of this project are two fold. Regionally it will employ a public outreach program to promote water resource education and awareness in Alaskan villages. This project will involve efforts to increase participation of Alaska Natives in undergraduate and graduate studies. Outreach will be accomplished by integrating this proposal into existing education infrastructure between the University of Alaska and some Seward Peninsula villages. Globally, the broader impact of this study lies in its extractability to the entire circumpolar Arctic. The Seward Peninsula lies at the southern boundary of continuous permafrost. In this environment, slight changes in the permafrost will cause long lasting changes to the hydrologic cycle and the quality and availability of freshwater. If the climate continues to warm, the southern boundary of permafrost will advance northward, eventually impacting all humans in the Arctic. The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the building of a model for interdisciplinary work that truly integrates the physical and social sciences. This project couples the work of a cultural anthropologist, a biologist, a hydrologist and an engineer. No one part of this project is independent. In order to understand the potential impacts of climate-induced changes in the hydrologic cycle on humans, two things are required. First, the potential hydrologic changes must be quantified. This requires regional scale modeling of a physical science. Second, the social science is necessary to characterize the human dependence on the resource and response to potential changes. Without the true integration of these two objectives one cannot begin to understand the intersection between climate change, water resources, and humans in the Arctic.

CAP studies human drivers and feedbacks of ecological change. Previous work concentrated on the central themes of urbanization patterns and processes altering the city's ecological conditions and surrounding environment, and ecological feedback-social system interactions. CAP-2 reorganizes the program into five new Integrative Project Areas (IPAs) to aid in the explicit inclusion of socioeconomic drivers and feedbacks: 1) land-use and land-cover change, 2) climate and ecosystem dynamics, 3) water policy, use and supply, 4) material flux and socio-ecosystem response, and 5) human control of biodiversity. The modus operandi for long-term monitoring, experiments, information management, site management, network participation and education/outreach was established during CAP-1 pilot projects. Projects continued into CAP-2 include: long-term monitoring at 200 sites across CAP; historical analyses of land use; classification of land cover; documentation of change in land cover and use; river monitoring above and below the city; and establishment of intensive sites for in-depth climatic, ecological, and social surveys and experiments. Three long-term experiments will be continued and a fourth initiated (a long-term factorial N+P fertilization along a deposition gradient). The recently established North Desert Village ""experimental suburb"" will be the first experimental study of its kind, with manipulations of vegetation types and irrigation methods alongside examination of people-ecological environment interactions at the neighborhood scale. Broader Impacts. The broader impacts of the proposed CAP project include: 1) raising the profile and awareness of urban ecology in both science and society, 2) contributing to education and outreach at all levels, 3) producing and maintaining a comprehensive, long-term database of ecological and social variables for a rapidly changing socio-ecosystem, and 4) promoting knowledge exchange with community and governmental decision makers.

The proposed research will expand the first phase BES work by addressing three fundamental questions: 1) How do the spatial structures of socio-economic, ecological and physical features of an urban area relate to one another and how do they change through time? 2) What are the fluxes of energy, matter, capital and population in the BES system, how do these fluxes relate to one another and how do they change over the long term? 3) How can people develop and use an understanding of the metropolis as an ecological system to improve the quality of their environment and to reduce pollution to downstream air and watersheds? Conceptual frameworks motivating these questions include ecological, hydrologic and social patch dynamics, the human ecosystem framework and the role of exotics in community organization, as well as theories in socio-spatial relationships, resilience, biocomplexity and urban design. Intellectual Contributions. The proposed research builds on data sets ranging from paleoecological, through historic time frames, to simulation of future scenarios. Highlights of proposed new research include: 1) using a $1 billion Baltimore City program to improve sanitary sewer infrastructure as an experimental manipulation, 2) an integrated physical, biological and social analysis of an urban watershed restoration (Watershed 263) project funded by over $1 million in U.S. Forest Service and other sources, 3) continued development of the first urban micrometeorological flux tower for analysis of carbon and water fluxes, and 4) continued development of ideas about the ecology of prestige, where lifestyle groups rather than more traditional metrics such as race, income and education are used to explain variation in urban ecosystem structure and function. Integration of these efforts will be facilitated by continued development and use of a new, high-resolution urban land cover classification system (HERCULES), and by a series of models that operate at different scales for different questions. Broader Impacts. BES research will exploit new, management-relevant environmental interventions, such as the Watershed 263 restoration initiative to explore the role of urban reforestation on stormwater management. Evaluation of improvements to Baltimore City's sewer infrastructure will yield results broadly useful to managers and policy makers and to educators and community groups in the affected water- and sewer-sheds. Modeling of ecosystem services will be a hallmark of the new research, providing information useful and interesting to citizens and decision leaders. New BES education and outreach initiatives will include analyses of how formal and informal approaches to education facilitate the ability of people to think about the city as an ecosystem and development of new modules for the Urban Forest Effects (UFORE) model to evaluate the health of urban forests and their effects on energy use and water and air pollution. Education activities will build on successful curriculum development, teacher workshops and interactions with K-12 students, with special attention on reaching under-represented groups. Training outside the classroom will include summer internships and after school programs at community centers and city environmental centers, again including under-represented groups.

LTER,,grant.3050535,423627,290,10,subset,93,No,The KBS LTER Project: Long-Term Ecological Research in Row-Crop Agriculture,The KBS LTER Project: Long-Term Ecological Research in Row-Crop Agriculture,"Initiated in 1987, the Kellogg Biological Station LTER (KBS) examines basic ecological relationships in field crop ecosystems to better understand internal processes controlling productivity independently of external subsidies (e.g., fertilizers, pesticides). The initial goal remains the same: effectively substituting ecological knowledge and theory in the agronomic management of cropping systems for a reliance on chemically based approaches. Research involves synergistic activities of long-term observations of contrasting cropping systems and successional vegetation, shorter-term field experiments, and modeling. Hypothesis testing relates to patterns and processes underlying ecosystem productivity and nutrient retention, including plant community dynamics, soil microbial populations, insect consumer dynamics, watershed and field-scale biogeochemistry, human interactions, and regional processes. KBS-4 is organized around the same initial hypothesis, albeit with a new conceptual research model and the addition of a new focus on valuation of ecosystem services. The model organizes ecological understanding of field crop ecosystems into components focused on ecological structure (e.g., organisms and their adaptations, population and community assemblages, and habitat structure) vis a vis ecological functions (e.g., biogeochemical processes, energy capture and flow, and hydrodynamics). Linkages between these components largely define the mechanisms that underlie the production of ecosystem goods and services, those products that provide the economic and social rationale for farming. Major research topics include plant community change, microbial processes, controls of arthropod communities, biogeochemical fluxes of solutes and trace gases, human valuation of cropland ecosystem services, and regionalization (scaling up via models). Broader Impacts. KBS is an established leader in developing and using ecological approaches to improving our understanding of agroecosystems. KBS research deals with food production, a topic of global significance, and has ready practical applications to the ongoing development of mid-western US agriculture, as well as the potential to make significant contributions to the more general area of sustainable agriculture. Outreach and educational activities are robust at KBS. Research findings are reaching the media, local and regional agricultural communities, and other key citizen groups influencing land management. KBS places a high priority on connections with agricultural policymaking and global-change issues. Several KBS scientists have testified to Congress on agricultural issues and strong international connections have been forged. The site has a significant on-the-ground outreach program offering a wide range of service and educational opportunities to the broader community including agricultural extension services, informal education, university coursework, research experience for undergraduate and graduate students, and Schoolyard LTER activities for K-12 students and educators. Contributions to the LTER network include the publication of a soils methods synthesis book and participation in the diversity x NPP and LINX network-wide studies. The site is close to full adoption of the Ecological Meta-Language (EML2) format standard to ensure easy data exchange.","Initiated in 1987, the Kellogg Biological Station LTER (KBS) examines basic ecological relationships in field crop ecosystems to better understand internal processes controlling productivity independently of external subsidies (e.g., fertilizers, pesticides).

However, important questions remain concerning the ability of urban parks to sustain meaningful ecosystem services that benefit city residents, despite multiple, accelerating challenges to ecological integrity, e.g., overpopulated deer, invasive plant and animal species, waste- and storm water impacts, especially within older, economically-challenged cities. Economic hardship has also resulted in an abundance of vacant/abandoned properties in many cities, which urban landscape designers often view as opportunities for re-development that incorporate natural amenities and ecosystem services into the urban core. The objectives of this research will be to investigate social determinants of stewardship and best management practices within park neighborhoods in response to educational and outreach programming and retrofit technologies supplied by a community-based watershed protection organization, and monitor the long-term changes in ecological, hydrologic, and socioeconomic variables in response to these interventions. Inventories and ecological/socioeconomic characterizations of vacant and abandoned properties within Cuyahoga County, Ohio, will be developed. This process will serve as a basis for planning the redevelopment of one or more neighborhoods and future implementation of long-term monitoring of ecological, hydrologic, and socioeconomic variables within those sites. The project will promote the integration of scientific and design approaches to urban ecosystem studies. The project will establish the Northeast Ohio Ecosystem Consortium (NEOECO), a multi-institutional partnership that will bring focus and integration to the region's considerable intellectual assets and research capacity in urban ecology, landscape design, urban planning, and natural resource management. The participation of leading agencies for natural resource management within NEOECO will promote the effective transfer of scientific knowledge into decision-making for management and revitalization of the degraded Cleveland urban ecosystem. Community-engagement through meetings, workshops, and the Internet are principal activities of this project. The NEOECO website will provide modes of access to project results and data tailored to scholarly, professional, and educational users. Educational outreach will also be accomplished by interacting with existing programs hosted by NEOECO participants that provide urban ecological training to students and teachers within the Cleveland Metropolitan School District. Graduate and undergraduate participants in the project will receive interdisciplinary training integrating elements of ecological science, resource management, and urban landscape design.","Current practices of urban park management and urban landscape design are often predicated upon the principle that enhancing ecosystem services within urban neighborhoods promotes both social and ecological stability by instilling pride-of-place and environmental stewardship values among neighborhood residents.
