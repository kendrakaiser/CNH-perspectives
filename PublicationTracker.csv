grant.3490857,1358861,Armed conflict and fisheries in the Lake Victoria basin,2019,S. Glaser et al. ,Ecology and Society,,2,1,4,19-Mar-20,"Civil conflict is the most prevalent form of armed conflict in the world today, but this significant driver of food and income security has been largely missing from studies of fisheries. Fisheries conflict is an example of complex dynamics operating in social-ecological systems. We theorize and document the existence of such a feedback loop between conflict in Uganda and fisheries in Lake Victoria. Civil war in northern Uganda resulted in mass human population displacement, which corresponded in time with increases in fishing effort in Lake Victoria. Subsequent changes in catch of Nile perch, the dominant commercial fishery, sparked armed conflict in the lake itself, at Migingo Island, between Uganda and Kenya. From this case study, we draw seven main conclusions. First, these correlation-based relationships are illustrative but not conclusive and we call for further empirical investigation. Second, the couplings between conflict and fishing subsystems are spatially asymmetric: conflict effects are diffuse in their links to broad changes in the fishery, whereas fishery effects may produce more localized conflict events. Third, and most relevant to conflict scholars, the drivers of fishing effort and catch may originate in different subsystems, but their changes and effects must be analyzed in concert. Fourth, the complex and path-dependent impacts of conflicts on natural resources in general, and fisheries in particular, highlights the urgent need for targeted surveys and more mechanistic understanding. Fifth, the open access nature of fisheries in Lake Victoria may exacerbate instabilities not present in other systems. Sixth, the diffuse and context-specific effects of conflicts on fisheries means models of fisheries management (e.g., stock assessment) should not incorporate conflict as a driver at this time. Finally, countries and their stakeholders should focus on diversification in employment for short term coping mechanisms during conflict as a means of shortcircuiting the conflict-fisheries feedback loop.",
grant.3485515,1311594,"Understanding the causes and consequences of differential decision-making in adaptation research: Adapting to a delayed monsoon onset in Gujarat, India",2015,M. Jain et al. ,Global Environmental Change,,2,1,70,19-Mar-20,"Weather variability poses numerous risks to agricultural communities, yet farmers may be able to reduce some of these risks by adapting their cropping practices to better suit changes in weather. However, not all farmers respond to weather variability in the same way. To better identify the causes and consequences of this heterogeneous decision-making, we develop a framework that identifies (1) which socio-economic and biophysical factors are associated with heterogeneous cropping decisions in response to weather variability and (2) which cropping strategies are the most adaptive, considering economic outcomes (e.g., yields and profits). This framework aims to understand how, why, and how effectively farmers adapt to current weather variability; these findings, in turn, may contribute to a more mechanistic and predictive understanding of individual-level adaptation to future climate variability and change. To illustrate this framework, we assessed how 779 farmers responded to delayed monsoon onset in fifteen villages in Gujarat, India during the 2011 growing season, when the monsoon onset was delayed by three weeks. We found that farmers adopted a variety of strategies to cope with delayed monsoon onset, including increasing irrigation use, switching to more drought-tolerant crops, and/or delaying sowing. We found that farmers’ access to and choice of strategies varied with their assets, irrigation access, perceptions of weather, and risk aversion. Richer farmers with more irrigation access used high levels of irrigation, and this strategy was associated with the highest yields in our survey sample. Poorer farmers with less secure access to irrigation were more likely to push back planting dates or switch crop type, and economic data suggest that these strategies were beneficial for those who did not have secure access to irrigation. Interestingly, after controlling for assets and irrigation access, we found that cognitive factors, such as beliefs that the monsoon onset date had changed over the last 20 years or risk aversion, were associated with increased adaptation. Our framework illustrates the importance of considering the complexity and heterogeneity of individual decision-making when conducting climate impact assessments or when developing policies to enhance the adaptive capacity of local communities to future climate variability and change.",

    ",2019,T. Elsey-Quirk et al. ,Scientific Reports,,3,3,2,19-Mar-20,"Marsh edge retreat by wave erosion, an ubiquitous process along estuaries, could affect vegetation dynamics in ways that differ from well-established elevation-driven interactions. Along the marshes of Delaware Bay (USA) we show that species composition from marsh edge to interior is driven by gradients in wave stress, bed elevation, and sediment deposition. At the marsh edge, large wave stress allows only short-statured species. Approximately 17m landward, decreasing wave stress and increasing deposition cause the formation of a ridge. There, high marsh fugitive and shrub species prevails. Both the marsh edge and the ridge retreat synchronously by several meters per year causing wave energy and deposition to change rapidly. Yet, the whole ecogeomorphologic profile translates landward in a dynamic equilibrium, where the low marsh replaces the high marsh ridge community and the high marsh ridge community replaces the mid-marsh grasses on the marsh plain. A plant competition model shows that the disturbances associated with sediment deposition are necessary for the high marsh species to outcompete the mid-marsh grasses during rapid transgression. Marsh retreat creates a moving framework of physical gradients and disturbances that promote the co-existence of over ten different species adjacent to the marsh edge in an otherwise species-poor landscape.",
grant.3118975,1038916,Individual versus group responses for non-market public goods,2018,C. Broadbent et al. ,The Social Science Journal,,3,3,0,19-Mar-20,"Stated preference methods have been used to value non-market public goods but questions remain about their incentive compatibility. A public goods referendum has proven to be incentive compatible for the more popular contingent valuation method. For attribute based choices, the choice experimental method values goods and services by attribute levels producing marginal values for the economic good. A referendum procedure has been proposed for this attribute based method but it is unclear how its use impacts participant choices. This research develops a controlled laboratory experiment eliciting individual and group responses for two non-market public goods using a referendum format for attribute based choice experiments. Results of the experiments find that a majority referendum rule induces individuals to form responses based upon group perceptions which may lead to non-truthful preference revelation.",
grant.3118945,1038651,A climate change projection for summer hydrologica conditions in a semiarid watershed of central Arizona,2015,G.A. Hawkins,Journal of Arid Environments,,3,3,16,19-Mar-20,"Potential climate change impacts on summer precipitation and subsequent hydrologic responses in the southwestern U.S. are poorly constrained at present due to a lack of studies accounting for high resolution processes. In this investigation, we apply a distributed hydrologic model to the Beaver Creek watershed of central Arizona to explore its utility for climate change assessments. Manual model calibration and model validation were performed using radar-based precipitation data during three summers and compared to two alternative meteorological products to illustrate the sensitivity of the streamflow response. Using the calibrated and validated model, we investigated the watershed response during historical (1990–2000) and future (2031–2040) summer projections derived from a single realization of a mesoscale model forced with boundary conditions from a general circulation model under a high emissions scenario. Results indicate spatially-averaged changes across the two projections: an increase in air temperature of 1.2 °C, a 2.4-fold increase in precipitation amount and a 3-fold increase in variability, and a 3.1-fold increase in streamflow amount and a 5.1-fold increase in variability. Nevertheless, relatively minor changes were obtained in spatially-averaged evapotranspiration. To explain this, we used the simulated hydroclimatological mechanisms to identify that higher precipitation limits radiation through cloud cover leading to lower evapotranspiration in regions with orographic effects. This challenges conventional wisdom on evapotranspiration trends and suggest that a more nuanced approach is needed to communicate hydrologic vulnerability to stakeholders and decision-makers in this semiarid region.",
grant.3061101,527587,Reducing nitrogen fertilzer application as a climate change mitigation strategy: Understanding farmer decision-making and potential barriers to change in the US,2014,D. Stuart et al. ,Land Use Policy,,3,2,110,19-Mar-20,"Nitrogen fertilizer use in agriculture is associated with water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. While practices and programs to reduce nitrogen fertilizer application continue to be developed, inefficient fertilizer use persists and little is known about farmer decision-making regarding application rates. The purpose of this study was to explore farmer decision-making in the context of reducing the application of nitrogen fertilizer as a climate change mitigation strategy and to assess barriers to reduced application and participating in a potential offsets program. Research methods included mail surveys, interviews, and focus groups with corn farmers in Michigan, United States (US). Results indicate that potential barriers to increasing nitrogen use efficiency for climate change mitigation include: perceptions about climate change, limited access to information and technological tools, and constraints imposed by the political economy of US agriculture. Education programs, government subsidies or cost-sharing programs, and including influential market and political actors in discussions about fertilizer use and climate change mitigation may address some of these barriers. Policies and programs focused on nitrogen fertilizer use and climate change mitigation in agriculture should be aware of these barriers and how they might be addressed.",
grant.3105229,928388,Soil carbon sensitivity to temperature and carbon use efficiency compared across microbial-ecosystem models of varying complexity,2014,J. Li et al. ,Biogeochemistry,,3,3,76,19-Mar-20,"Global ecosystem models may require microbial components to accurately predict feedbacks between climate warming and soil decomposition, but it is unclear what parameters and levels of complexity are ideal for scaling up to the globe. Here we conducted a model comparison using a conventional model with first-order decay and three microbial models of increasing complexity that simulate short- to long-term soil carbon dynamics. We focused on soil carbon responses to microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) and temperature. Three scenarios were implemented in all models: constant CUE (held at 0.31), varied CUE (−0.016 °C−1), and 50 % acclimated CUE (−0.008 °C−1). Whereas the conventional model always showed soil carbon losses with increasing temperature, the microbial models each predicted a temperature threshold above which warming led to soil carbon gain. The location of this threshold depended on CUE scenario, with higher temperature thresholds under the acclimated and constant scenarios. This result suggests that the temperature sensitivity of CUE and the structure of the soil carbon model together regulate the long-term soil carbon response to warming. Equilibrium soil carbon stocks predicted by the microbial models were much less sensitive to changing inputs compared to the conventional model. Although many soil carbon dynamics were similar across microbial models, the most complex model showed less pronounced oscillations. Thus, adding model complexity (i.e. including enzyme pools) could improve the mechanistic representation of soil carbon dynamics during the transient phase in certain ecosystems. This study suggests that model structure and CUE parameterization should be carefully evaluated when scaling up microbial models to ecosystems and the globe.",
grant.3029244,216560,Agrarian legacy in soil nutrient pools of urbanizing arid lands,2006,D.B. Lewis,Global Change,,3,3,57,19-Mar-20,"Today's worldwide expansion of dry land cities consumes cultivated and native ecosystems, providing laboratories for investigating imprints of former land use in places where people now live. Around Phoenix, USA, we compared soil nutrient pools in residential yards converted from farms with nutrient pools in yards developed on native desert. Organic matter, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and soluble ions were >2‐fold greater in yards that were previously agrarian than in yards that were not. These pools remain elevated 40 years after land conversion to residential use. Present N accumulation (1.5 g m−2 yr−1) is not affected by prior land use, suggesting that rates of residential fertilizer application and retention are not affected by antecedent soil fertility. Bioavailable, inorganic phosphorus (Pav) is elevated in soil with a recent agrarian past, but this signal disappears after 10–30 years of residential use owing to an accumulation of Pav in never‐farmed yards. Our results indicate a ‘direct agrarian legacy,’ wherein agrarian amendment of nutrient pools endures urbanization, more so than an ‘indirect legacy,’ wherein present land management is molded by former land use. Agriculture in dry lands thus sequesters material in soils, and—as we also found higher material contents in residential soils than in contemporary agrarian soils—residential land use simply adds to the agrarian legacy these soils already bear. Intense human use of arid lands may cause increases in material pools in soils, a condition with potential global consequence.",

Kareiva,Trends in Ecology and Evolution ,,1,2,82,19-Mar-20,"One of the most ambitious ecological studies of the past few decades was the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), which examined the consequences of ecosystem change for human well-being. The MA developed global ecological scenarios as a process to inform policy options, despite enormous uncertainties. These scenarios were based on an interlocking suite of models that forecast the future. Following the recent completion and publication of the MA, there is now movement towards making the value of ecosystem services an integral part of key policy decisions. Here, we review the MA approach and suggest areas where immediate progress can be made to increase the likelihood that decision-makers will embrace the vision of assessments such as the MA.",

Springborn,Review of Economics and Statistics,,1,1,13,19-Mar-20,"This paper examines the implications of a binary action, binary outcome decision problem for estimating risk. We use data on the invasiveness of biological imports to develop the first comparison of two classical methods—maximum likelihood and Bayesian—against a third, the recently developed maximum utility (MU) approach. MU estimation uniquely takes advantage of the structure of the decision problem, which depends on a local rather than global fit to the model. Extending methods to account for an endogenously stratified sample, we show that the MU approach is less sensitive to specification error and can offer significant economic gains under model uncertainty.",

Gearheard et al. ,Ambio,,1,1,154,19-Mar-20,"The Arctic environment, including sea ice, is changing. The impacts of these changes to Inuit and Iñupiat ways of life vary from place to place, yet there are common themes as well. The study reported here involved an exchange of hunters, Elders, and others from Barrow, Alaska, USA, and Clyde River, Nunavut, Canada, as members of a larger research team that also included visiting scientists. Although the physical environments of Barrow and Clyde River are strikingly different, the uses of the marine environment by residents, including sea ice, had many common elements. In both locations, too, extensive changes have been observed in recent years, forcing local residents to respond in a variety of ways. Although generally in agreement or complementary to one another, scientific and indigenous knowledge of sea ice often reflect different perspectives and emphases. Making generalizations about impacts and responses is challenging and should therefore be approached with caution. Technology provides some potential assistance in adapting to changing sea ice, but by itself, it is insufficient and can sometimes have undesirable consequences. Reliable knowledge that can be applied under changing conditions is essential. Collaborative research and firsthand experience are critical to generating such new knowledge.",

Meier,Annals of Glaciology,,1,1,28,25-Mar-20,"Passive microwave imagery indicates a decreasing trend in Arctic Summer Sea-ice extent Since 1979. The Summers of 2002–05 have exhibited particularly reduced extent and have reinforced the downward trend. Even the winter periods have now Shown decreasing trends. At the local level, Arctic residents are also noticing changes in Sea ice. In particular, indigenous elders and hunters report changes Such as earlier break-up, later freeze-up and thinner ice. The changing conditions have profound implications for Arctic-wide climate, but there is also regional variability in the extent trends. These can have important ramifications for wildlife and indigenous communities in the affected regions. Here we bring together observations from remote Sensing with observations and knowledge of Inuit who live in the Baffin Bay region. Weaving the complementary perspectives of Science and Inuit knowledge, we investigate the processes driving changes in Baffin Bay Sea-ice extent and discuss the present and potential future effects of changing Sea ice on local activities.",

In all cases, fishing fleets behave rationally within the imposed regulatory structures. Successful, generalist fishermen who take risks often pioneer developing fisheries. At this stage, regulations and subsidies tend to encourage excessive entry and investments, creating the potential for serial depletion. In mature fisheries, regulations often restrict season length, vessel and gear types, fishing areas, and fleet size, causing or exacerbating the race for fish and excessive investment, and are typically unsuccessful except when combined with dedicated access privileges (e.g., territorial rights, individual quotas). In senescent fisheries, vessel buyback programs must account for the fishing power of individuals and their vessels. Subsidies should be avoided as they prolong the transition towards alternative employment. Fisheries managers need to create individual incentives that align fleet dynamics and fishermen behavior with the intended societal goals. These incentives can be created both through management systems like dedicated access privileges and through market forces.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

The aggregate behaviour of fishing fleets can be predicted and managed with appropriate incentives. To determine appropriate incentives, we should look to successes to learn what works and what does not. In different fisheries incentive systems have been found to reduce the race‐for‐fish and make fisheries profitable, to stimulate stock rebuilding, to reduce bycatch, and to provide for reductions in illegal fishing. Yet, success can be evaluated in many dimensions, but is, in fact, rarely done – per cent overfished seems to be the dominant measure of performance. I evaluate the yield lost due to overfishing in several ecosystems and contrast the situation of North Atlantic cod where considerable yield is lost, to fisheries in New Zealand and the west coast of the USA where lost yield due to overfishing is very small. Much more systematic evaluation of the other aspects of fisheries performance is greatly needed. From examples explored in this paper I conclude that prevention of overfishing can be achieved with strong central governments enforcing conservative catch regulations, but economic success appears to require an appropriate incentive structure.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10
grant.2992744,410437,Biodiversity loss in the ocean: How bad is it?,2007,"Hilborn, RW",SCIENCE,2,2,2,59,26-Mar-20,"The Research Article Impacts of biodiversity loss on ocean ecosystem services By B. Worm et al.(3 Nov. 2006, p. 787) projects that 100 of seafood-producing species stocks will collapse by 2048. The projection is inaccurate and overly pessimistic. Worm et al. define collapse as occurring when the current year's catch is <10 of the highest observed in a stock's time series. However, fish catch is rarely an adequate proxy for fish abundance, particularly for rebuilding stocks under management. A variety of biological, economic, and social factors and management decisions determine catches; low catches may occur even when stocks are high (e.g., due to low fish prices or the effects of restrictive management practices), and vice versa. The inadequacy of Worm et al.'s abundance proxy is illustrated by the time series of data for Georges Bank haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus). The highest catch for haddock occurred in 1965 at 150,362 tons (1). This catch occurred during a period of intense domestic and international fishing (1). In 2003, haddock catch was 12,576 tons, or 8 of the time series maximum. Under the Worm et al. definition, the stock would be categorized as collapsed in 2003. However, stock assessment data (1) estimate the total magnitude of the spawning biomass in 2003 to be 91 of that in 1965. Comparing the estimate of spawning stock biomass in 2003 to the level producing maximum sustainable yield (MSY), the stock was not even being overfished in 2003 (2). Because adequate stock abundance measures exist for only a portion of world fish stocks, this purported worldwide meta analysis required using data that represent the lowest common denominator of datathe total magnitude of the catch. However, if the catch ratio metric is so prone to misrepresentation of the true status of populations, as illustrated above, a synthesis of world fisheries based on these data is equally flawed. At the least, the authors should have conducted a calibration of their stock collapse metric with more complete stock abundance data available from the many worldwide sources where such data exist.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Anadromous salmon transport marine‐derived nutrients and carbon to freshwater and riparian ecosystems upon their return to natal spawning systems. The ecological implications of these subsidies on the trophic ecology of resident fish remain poorly understood despite broad recognition of their potential importance. 2. We studied the within‐year changes in the ration size, composition and stable isotope signature of the diets of two resident salmonids (rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss; Arctic grayling, Thymallus arcticus) before and after the arrival of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) to their spawning grounds in the Bristol Bay region of southwest Alaska. 3. Ration size and energy intake increased by 480–620% for both species after salmon arrived. However, the cause of the increases differed between species such that rainbow trout switched to consuming salmon eggs, salmon flesh and blowflies that colonized salmon carcasses, whereas grayling primarily ate more benthic invertebrates that were presumably made available because of physical disturbances by spawning salmon. 4. We also observed an increase in the δ15N of rainbow trout diets post‐salmon, but not for grayling. This presumably led to the observed increase in the δ15N of rainbow trout with increasing body mass, but not for grayling. 5. Using a bioenergetics model, we predicted that salmon‐derived resources contributed a large majority of the energy necessary for growth in this resident fish community. Furthermore, the bioenergetics model also showed how seasonal changes in diet affected the stable isotope ratios of both species. These results expand upon a growing body of literature that highlights the different pathways whereby anadromous salmon influence coastal ecosystems, particularly resident fish.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10
grant.2992744,410437,A metapopulation perspective for salmon and other anadromous fish,2007,"Schtickzelle, N; Quinn, TP.",FISH AND FISHERIES,3,2,1,102,26-Mar-20,"Salmonids are an important component of biodiversity, culture and economy in several regions, particularly the North Pacific Rim. Given this importance, they have been intensively studied for about a century, and the pioneering scientists recognized the critical link between population structure and conservation. Spatial structure is indeed of prime importance for salmon conservation and management. At first glance, the essence of the metapopulation concept, i.e. a population of populations, widely used on other organisms like butterflies, seems to be particularly relevant to salmon, and more generally to anadromous fish. Nevertheless, the concept is rarely used, and barely tested. Here, we present a metapopulation perspective for anadromous fish, assessing in terms of processes rather than of patterns the set of necessary conditions for metapopulation dynamics to exist. Salmon, and particularly sockeye salmon in Alaska, are used as an illustrative case study. A review of life history traits indicates that the three basic conditions are likely to be fulfilled by anadromous salmon: (i) the spawning habitat is discrete and populations are spatially separated by unsuitable habitat; (ii) some asynchrony is present in the dynamics of more or less distant populations and (iii) dispersal links populations because some salmon stray from their natal population. The implications of some peculiarities of salmon life history traits, unusual in classical metapopulations, are also discussed. Deeper understanding of the population structure of anadromous fish will be advanced by future studies on specific topics: (i) criteria must be defined for the delineation of suitable habitats that are based on features of the biotope and not on the presence of fish; (ii) the collection of long‐term data and the development of improved methods to determine age structure are essential for correctly estimating levels of asynchrony between populations and (iii) several key aspects of dispersal are still poorly understood and need to be examined in detail: the spatial and temporal scales of dispersal movements, the origin and destination populations instead of simple straying rates, and the relative reproductive success of immigrants and residents.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Understanding the context dependency of these types of impacts remains challenging. For example, organisms may perform different functions at different densities. Anadromous salmon accumulate > 99% of their lifetime growth in marine ecosystems, and then return to spawn, often at high densities, in relatively confined freshwaters. While previous research has focused on how salmon nutrients can fertilize benthic communities, we examined how an ecosystem engineer, sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka, influences seasonal dynamics of stream benthic communities through their nest‐digging activities in south‐western Alaska, USA. Benthic invertebrate and algal abundance were quantified every 7–14 days during the open water seasons of 10 streams in riffle and run habitats across multiple years, leading to 25 different stream‐year combinations that spanned a large gradient of salmon density. In streams with few or no salmon, benthic algal and insect biomass were fairly constant throughout the season. However, in streams with more than 0·1 salmon m−2, algal and insect biomass decreased by an average of 75–85% during salmon spawning. Algal biomass recovered quickly following salmon disturbance, occasionally reaching pre‐salmon biomass. In contrast, in streams with more than 0·1 salmon m−2, aquatic insect populations did not recover to pre‐salmon levels within the same season. We observed no positive impacts of salmon on algae or insects via fertilization from carcass nutrients. Salmon, when their populations exceed thresholds in spawning density, are an important component of stream disturbance regimes and influence seasonal dynamics of benthic communities. Human activities that drive salmon densities below threshold densities, as has likely happened in many streams, will lead to altered seasonal dynamics of stream communities. Human activities that alter animal populations that are sources of biogenic disturbance can result in shifts in community dynamics.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

",Transactions of the American Fisheries Society,3,3,3,28,26-Mar-20,"A large and growing body of literature has documented the transfer of marine‐derived nutrients from the ocean to freshwater and riparian systems by semelparous Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. The pathways by which these nutrients reach resident fish are often indirect, and the evidence for direct benefits to the resident fish is not always conclusive. However, the consumption of salmon tissue (in one form or another) by resident fish would constitute a direct and efficient pathway for energy transfer. We studied a population of small‐bodied, nonanadromous Dolly Varden Salvelinus malma feeding on the fry and eggs of sockeye salmon O. nerka and blowfly (family Calliphoridae) larvae that had fed on salmon carcasses at a series of spring‐fed and otherwise unproductive ponds in southwestern Alaska. The Dolly Varden fed heavily on sockeye salmon fry when available, shifted their diet almost exclusively to eggs after salmon spawning commenced, and then shifted to blowfly larvae toward the end of the season. Dolly Varden large enough to eat eggs moved into ponds where sockeye salmon spawn synchronously with the arrival of the salmon, and Dolly Varden growth rates increased greatly once salmon eggs and blowfly maggots were available. Young‐of‐the‐year Dolly Varden, which were too small to eat eggs and fry, were concentrated in small streams between ponds where fewer sockeye salmon spawn, perhaps to minimize the risk of predation from larger conspecifics. These results indicate the importance of a pulse of salmon‐related food resources for this population of resident fish and their adaptations to take advantage of these resources. It is likely that similar dependence occurs in other systems where sockeye salmon produce a suite of temporally predictable energy resources; thus, resident fish may depend on large populations of salmon.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Some of this change occurs as native vegetation is replaced by annual crops, but change in the latter half of the 20th Century has also occurred through the simplification of diverse systems that formerly included perennial forages and annual crops (Bullock, 1992). Extreme examples of these processes can be seen over the last century in the U.S. Midwest, where prairies, savannas, forests, and wetlands have been almost completely replaced by corn and soybean (Figure 1). Landscape simplification and the expansion of annual crops have been accompanied, and to a large extent driven, by the broad scale use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, new cultivars and machinery, and soil drainage and irrigation.

To address limitations of conventional approaches to analyzing isotopic data, especially when isotopic profiles in the soil are complex, we employ an alternative ‘multiple source mass-balance isotopic’ approach suitable for determining probable contributions of multiple potential sources to total plant water uptake. Observed differences in isotopic profiles among the plant communities were attributed to differences in infiltration rates, plant water uptake rates, the degree of evaporative isotopic fractionation under the different vegetative covers, and processes of hydraulic redistribution. Savanna (Quercus macrocarpa Mixch) and woodland (Q. macrocarpa, Umus americana L.) trees had the lowest stem water δ18O values (−6.12‰, −7.77‰, and −7.61‰, respectively), whereas corn (Zea mays L.) and prairie (Andropogon gerardii) exhibited higher stem water δ18O values (−5.49‰ and −5.85‰, respectively), suggesting more shallow sources of water uptake for the latter. Frequency histographs produced from the multiple source mass-balance analysis confirmed that the corn and prairie species obtained up to 45% and 36% of their water from the upper 0–20 cm soil horizon, respectively. In contrast, oak trees growing in the savanna and woodland obtained up to 40% and 20% of their water from the upper 20 cm, and up to 60% and 80% of their water from depths >60 cm, respectively. Lack of strong isotopic gradients in the soil profiles combined with irregularities in the slope of the isotopic gradient by depth complicated interpretation of the data. However, an important advantage of the alternative multiple source mass-balance isotopic approach over conventional approaches was its capability of producing more quantitative and objective estimates for the probable contributions of multiple sources to total plant water uptake. This study highlights how changes in land use and vegetative cover in the Midwest affects plant water uptake patterns, and suggests how these changes may influence larger landscape scale alterations in the hydrologic balance.",actual title differs from the one listed on the grants page

Despite numerous gradual changes in prey availability and vegetative cover, regional populations of Serengeti lions remained stable for 10- to 20-year periods and only shifted to new equilibria in sudden leaps. Although gradually improving environmental conditions provided sufficient resources to permit the subdivision of preexisting territories, regional lion populations did not expand until short-term conditions supplied enough prey to generate large cohorts of surviving young. The results of a simulation model show that the observed pattern of “saltatory equilibria” results from the lions' grouping behavior.",

grant.3037337,308486,"Plant productivity and soil nitrogen as a function of grazing, migration, and fire in an African savanna",2007,Holdo et al.,Journal of Ecology,1,3,3,88,19-Mar-20,"Herbivores can play a key role in affecting ecosystem function, but their direct and indirect effects are often confounded with each other and have rarely been dissected. Predictions for open systems, i.e. those with cross‐habitat nutrient fluxes and dispersal, may differ from those expected in closed systems, where no such transfers occur, but these differences have only recently begun to be characterized. We present a theoretical model of plant productivity and soil nitrogen (N) based on the Serengeti ecosystem in order to investigate the interplay among herbivore movement, nutrient transport across habitats (spatial subsidies), the fire regime and the effects of herbivores on N cycling. Model results suggest that the fire regime and herbivore migration are key determinants of primary productivity and fertility, and that the impact of these factors depends on grazing intensity. At low intensity, high grass biomass leads to extensive fires and N volatilization, but this effect is reduced at high grazing intensity. Without migration, the model predicts that primary productivity and fertility initially increase, then decline with increasing grazing intensity. Conversely, seasonal migration decouples the growing and grazing seasons, leading to a monotonic increase in productivity with grazing intensity. Cross‐habitat N transport has a relatively modest effect on N dynamics, and the magnitude of the seasonality effect outweighs the spatial subsidy effect. Our model suggests that herbivores and fire may play key interactive 
roles in regulating producers and determining ecosystem functional 
properties in grazing systems, both through consumption and via indirect
 effects on nutrient availability. The direction and magnitude of these 
effects could potentially vary greatly among ecosystems with resident 
vs. migratory herbivores, suggesting that spatial coupling through 
animal movement can be important at both the population and ecosystem 
levels.This study suggests that the degree to which trophic interactions 
influence ecosystem function may be strongly modulated by whether 
systems are open or closed. It also suggests that direct and indirect 
effects of consumers on their resources (top‐down effects) may be far 
more important than nutrient subsidies in open terrestrial systems.",
grant.3037338,308486,Group formation stabilizes predator-prey dynamics in Serengeti,2007,Fryxell et al. ,Nature,3,3,3,197,19-Mar-20,"Theoretical ecology is largely founded on the principle of mass action, in which uncoordinated populations of predators and prey move in a random and well-mixed fashion across a featureless landscape. The conceptual core of this body of theory is the functional response, predicting the rate of prey consumption by individual predators as a function of predator and/or prey densities1,2,3,4,5. This assumption is seriously violated in many ecosystems in which predators and/or prey form social groups. Here we develop a new set of group-dependent functional responses to consider the ecological implications of sociality and apply the model to the Serengeti ecosystem. All of the prey species typically captured by Serengeti lions (Panthera leo) are gregarious, exhibiting nonlinear relationships between prey-group density and population density. The observed patterns of group formation profoundly reduce food intake rates below the levels expected under random mixing, having as strong an impact on intake rates as the seasonal migratory behaviour of the herbivores. A dynamical system model parameterized for the Serengeti ecosystem (using wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) as a well-studied example) shows that grouping strongly stabilizes interactions between lions and wildebeest. Our results suggest that social groups rather than individuals are the basic building blocks around which predator–prey interactions should be modelled and that group formation may provide the underlying stability of many ecosystems.",
grant.3037339,308486,Rainfall and soils modify plant community response to grazing in Serengeti National Park,2007,Anderson et al.,Ecology,3,3,3,95,19-Mar-20,"Terrestrial plant community responses to herbivory depend on resource availability, but the separate influences of different resources are difficult to study because they often correlate across natural environmental gradients. We studied the effects of excluding ungulate herbivores on plant species richness and composition, as well as available soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), across eight grassland sites in Serengeti National Park (SNP), Tanzania. These sites varied independently in rainfall and available soil N and P. Excluding herbivores decreased plant species richness at all sites and by an average of 5.4 species across all plots. Although plant species richness was a unimodal function of rainfall in both grazed and ungrazed plots, fences caused a greater decrease in plant species richness at sites of intermediate rainfall compared to sites of high or low rainfall. In terms of the relative or proportional decreases in plant species richness, excluding herbivores caused the strongest relative decreases at lower rainfall and where exclusion of herbivores increased available soil P. Herbivore exclusion increased among‐plot heterogeneity in species composition but decreased coexistence of congeneric grasses. Compositional similarity between grazed and ungrazed treatments decreased with increasing rainfall due to greater forb richness in exclosures and greater sedge richness outside exclosures and was not related to effects of excluding herbivores on soil nutrients. Our results show that plant resources, especially water and P, appear to modulate the effects of herbivores on tropical grassland plant diversity and composition. We show that herbivore effects on soil P may be an important and previously unappreciated mechanism by which herbivores influence plant diversity, at least in tropical grasslands.",

Fire and herbivory effects on the nutritive quality of savanna vegetation can occur directly, independent of changes in the plant community, or indirectly, via effects on the plant community. Indirect effects can be further subdivided into those occurring because of changes in plant species composition or plant abundance (i.e., quality versus quantity). We studied relationships between fire, herbivory, rainfall, soil fertility, and leaf nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sodium (Na) at 30 sites inside and outside of Serengeti National Park. Using structural equation modeling, we asked whether fire and herbivory influences were largely direct or indirect and how their signs and strengths differed within the context of natural savanna processes. Herbivory was associated with enhanced leaf N and P through changes in plant biomass and community composition. Fire was associated with reduced leaf nutrient concentrations through changes in plant community composition. Additionally, fire had direct positive effects on Na and nonlinear direct effects on P that partially mitigated the indirect negative effects. Key mechanisms by which fire reduced plant nutritive quality were through reductions of Na‐rich grasses and increased abundance of Themeda triandra, which had below‐average leaf nutrients.",

It remains unclear whether this process has important effects in mature natural ecosystems where competitive feedbacks and complex environmental influences affect diversity–productivity relationships. In this study, we evaluated diversity–productivity relationships while statistically controlling for environmental influences in 12 natural grassland ecosystems. Because diversity–productivity relationships are conspicuously nonlinear, we developed a nonlinear structural equation modeling (SEM) methodology to separate the effects of diversity on productivity from the effects of productivity on diversity. Meta‐analysis was used to summarize the SEM findings across studies. While competitive effects were readily detected, enhancement of production by diversity was not. These results suggest that the influence of small‐scale diversity on productivity in mature natural systems is a weak force, both in absolute terms and relative to the effects of other controls on productivity.",

Testing the relationship between Christian church affiliation and shamanism in 23 Makushi and Wapishana communities in southern Guyana, we found that Evangelicals and Sabbatarians are less likely to visit shamans or accept their legitimacy than are Anglicans and Catholics. However, conversion does not necessarily imply a complete rejection of indigenous religious systems as many self-identified Evangelicals and Sabbatarians continue to adhere to some indigenous beliefs and practices.

Developing this potential, however, presents significant challenges to geographic information science. Modelling the spatio‐temporal behaviour of individuals requires new representational forms that capture how organisms store and use spatial information. New procedures must be developed that simulate how individuals produce bounded knowledge of geographical space through experiential learning, adapt this knowledge to continually changing environments, and apply it to spatial decision‐making processes. In this paper, we present a framework for the representation of adaptive, spatially aware, and mobile agents. To provide context to this research, a multiagent model is constructed to simulate the migratory behaviour of elk (Cervus elaphus) on Yellowstone's northern range.

grant.3029263,216588,Elk alter habitat selection as an antipredator response to wolves,2005,Creel et al. ,Ecology,3,2,2,660,20-Mar-20,"For elk (Cervus elaphus) in the Gallatin drainage of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, Montana, USA, wolf movements caused local predation risk to vary substantially on a time scale of days. Spatially and temporally fine‐scaled data from GPS radio collars show that elk moved into the protective cover of wooded areas when wolves were present, reducing their use of preferred grassland foraging habitats that had high predation risk. By constraining habitat selection, wolves may have greater effects on elk dynamics than would be predicted on the basis of direct predation alone. Based on changes in the woody vegetation following the reintroduction of wolves, it has been suggested that antipredator responses by elk may be driving a trophic cascade in the Yellowstone ecosystem. However, studies to date have been hampered by a lack of direct data on spatial variation in predation risk, and the ways in which elk respond to variation in risk. Our data support a central portion of the hypothesis that elk antipredator behavior could drive a trophic cascade, but changes in elk numbers are also likely to have affected elk–plant interactions.",

Similar battles are being fought over science, uncertainty, and wild animals in the American west, however, with far less attention to local epistemologies. Often dismissed as “barstool biology”, the ecological knowledges of local hunters in the Northern Yellowstone ecosystem are rooted in environmental experience and situated politics. How does local hunter knowledge diverge or converge with that of state officials, environmentalists, ranchers, and other constituencies, and to what effect on wildlife management policy? This paper seeks to answer that question, reviewing recent research amongst local resource users, managers, and activists in Montana. By rendering empirical the question of local knowledge around America’s oldest national park, rather than trying to “read it off” political affiliation, education, or livelihood, a clearer picture of power, knowledge, and conservation emerges. The results suggest that emerging management policies have developed from the discursive alliance of landowners, outfitters, and environmentalists, shifting priorities towards enclosure and exclusion in wildlife at the expense of other silent constituencies.",

This article reviews current understandings of ecological disturbance and conservation noncompliance, concluding that differing forms of noncompliance hold differing implications for diversity. The authors suggest that forms of anthropogenic patchy disturbance resulting from violation may maintain, if not enhance, floral diversity.

Our main focus is on the role of private ranchland in elk ecology, and the ability of land owners to set elk migration in new directions through cumulative decisions about hunting and tolerating elk. This takes elk management, traditionally the purview of the state, out of administrative control. We document connections between the region’s historical and emerging land tenure patterns, and analyze associated changes in hunter access. Elk numbers expanded rapidly in the Upper Yellowstone Valley at a moment of significant transition in ranchland tenure. New owners more interested in natural amenities than in livestock production encouraged the elk and discouraged hunting. This reinforced the spread of elk, and further weakened the ability of the state and other ranchers to manage elk (which interfere with livestock production in numerous ways). Though elk and cattle use the landscape in similar ways, elk became more effective agents of landscape change in a reflexive relationship with ideas of land that stress natural amenities over production.",

When modeling a multi-scale system, a ‘top-down’ approach—basing models on emergent variables and interactions, rather than explicitly on the much faster and smaller scale processes that give rise to them—facilitates both goals. Parameterizations representing emergent interactions range from highly simplified and abstracted to more quantitatively accurate. Empirically based large-scale parameterizations lead more reliably to accurate large-scale behavior than do parameterizations of much smaller scale processes. Conversely, purposefully simplified representations of model interactions can enhance a model's utility for explanation, clarifying the key feedbacks leading to an enigmatic behavior. For such potential insights to be relevant, the interactions in the model need to correspond to those in the ‘real’ system in some straightforward way. Such a correspondence usually holds for models constructed for predictive purposes, although this is not a requirement. The goals motivating a modeling endeavor help determine the most appropriate modeling strategies, as well as the most appropriate criteria for judging model usefulness.",
grant.3057631,507987,Patterns in the sand: From forcing templates to self organization,2007,Coco and Murray,Geomorphology,3,3,3,111,26-Mar-20,"The nearshore region exhibits many striking morphological patterns with a variety of spatial and temporal scales. The formation of these rhythmic features has been initially ascribed, depending on the pattern in question, to spatial structures in the flow or geological constrains. These forcing templates have been hypothesized to provide the spatial structure that becomes imprinted on the shoreline or seabed morphology. More recently, new explanations for rhythmic patterns have involved interactions between fluid flow and sediment transport that create morphological feedbacks and lead to pattern self-organization. While forcing-template models do not explicitly treat transport of the sediment that makes up the pattern, self-organization models focus on the strong couplings within flow/sediment systems, and on interactions between emergent structures. We illustrate the sweeping shift from template explanations to self-organization by discussing four nearshore patterns: beach cusps, surfzone crescentic sandbars, inner-shelf sorted bedforms, and large-scale cuspate shorelines. Models involving self-organization show that local interactions between flow and sediment transport can collectively give rise to patterns with large-scale coherence and that the driving feedbacks can be associated with either topographical or grain-size composition instabilities. An approach based on self-organization also allows researchers to establish limitations in the predictability of the occurrence of rhythmic patterns and characteristics as well as to study mechanisms leading to the observed variability of pattern or lack of regularity.",

These issues are most often investigated in a cross‐shore profile framework, fostering the implicit assumption that coastline responses will be approximately uniform in the alongshore direction. However, experiments with a recently developed numerical model of coastline change on a large spatial domain suggest that the shoreline responses to climate change could be highly variable. As storm and wave climates change, large‐scale coastline shapes are likely to shift—causing areas of greatly accelerated coastal erosion to alternate with areas of considerable shoreline accretion. On complex‐shaped coastlines, including cuspate‐cape and spit coastlines, the alongshore variation in shoreline retreat rates could be an order of magnitude higher than the baseline retreat rate expected from sea‐level rise alone.",

Neither have addressed the physical nor economic interactions between adjacent nourishing communities. Here, we couple a numerical model of coastline evolution and a cost-benefit model of beach nourishment, allowing adjacent communities to make dynamic nourishment decisions. Beach nourishment benefits adjacent communities both “updrift” and “downdrift.” The total amount of money spent on nourishment activities can decrease by as much as 25% when adjacent communities both conduct on-going nourishment projects, as opposed to the case where each community nourishes in isolation.",

Despite the dynamic nature of sandy barrier islands, economic incentive and recreational opportunities attract humans and development. Storm-driven sediment-transport events that build barrier islands constitute hazards to humans and infrastructure, and manipulations aimed at preventing or mitigating such events link human actions and long-term island morphodynamics. To explore how the behavior of a natural barrier island differs from one in which humans are dynamic system constituents, we use a numerical model of storm-driven sediment redistributions within the shoreface/island/back-barrier system and human rearrangements of sediment within the subaerial barrier island. In a modeled natural system, periods of dune growth and island stability, initiated by stochastic lulls in storm activity, alternate with stormy periods, in which shoreline erosion and frequent overwash regulate dune heights. When humans are included in the model, overwash deposits are removed from the island, and artificially high dunes are rebuilt. These manipulations tend to filter moderate overwash events. However, with shoreline erosion and rising sea level, these manipulations promote lower and narrower islands in the long term, so that when dunes are overtopped, the sediment redistributions are more severe. Thus, the coupled human/barrier system exhibits wider swings between increased island stability and sudden island displacements. Increasing the height of artificially maintained dunes increases the rate of island narrowing and, therefore, infrastructure relocation, and increases the need for sediment to be imported from outside the system.",

Previous studies indicate that beach width positively affects coastal property values, but these studies ignore the dynamic features of beaches and the feedback that nourishment has on shoreline retreat. We correct for the resulting attenuation and endogeneity bias in a hedonic property value model by instrumenting for beach width using spatially varying coastal geological features. We find that the beach width coefficient is nearly five times larger than the OLS estimate, suggesting that beach width is a much larger portion of property value than previously thought. We use the empirical results to parameterize a dynamic optimization model of beach nourishment decisions and show that the predicted interval between nourishment projects is closer to what we observe in the data when we use the estimate from the instrumental variables model rather than OLS. As coastal communities adapt to climate change, we find that the long-term net value of coastal residential property can fall by as much as 52% when erosion rate triples and cost of nourishment sand quadruples.",

In this paper, we couple a human component to a numerical model of large‐scale coastline evolution, incorporating beach “nourishment” (periodically placing sand on the beach, also called “beach replenishment” or “beach fill”). Beach nourishment is the most prevalent means humans employ to alter the natural shoreline system in our case study, the Carolina coastline. Beach nourishment can cause shorelines adjacent to those that are nourished to shift both seaward and landward. When we further consider how changes to storm behaviors could change wave climates, the magnitude of morphological change induced by beach nourishment can rival that expected from sea level rise and affect the coast as far as tens of kilometers away from the nourishment site.

Investigations of coastal response to climate change typically consider natural processes in isolation neglecting repeated changes to the coastline from human actions, primarily through shoreline nourishment projects, which add sand to the shoreline to counteract erosion. In a model coupling economically driven shoreline nourishment with wave- and sea level rise-driven coastline change, and accounting for dwindling sediment resources for nourishment, coastline response depends dramatically on the relationship between patterns of property value and erosion. Simulations show that when nourishment costs rise with depletion of sand resources, coastline change is tied to the interaction between patterns of erosion and property value. Simulations show that when high property values align with highly erosive locations, sand resources are depleted rapidly and nourishment in lower property value towns is quickly abandoned. Although our model simulates a particular coastal morphology, the result that future behavior of the coastline and the economic viability of nourishment in a given town depend on the regional interaction between patterns of property value and erosion is likely applicable to many coastal configurations. More broadly, coupling economic and physical models reveals equity and sustainability implications of coastal climate adaptation as well as patterns of coastline change that a physical model alone would overlook.",
grant.3057641,507987,Emergent behavior in a coupled economic and coastline model for beach nourishment,2011,Lazarus et al. ,Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics,1,1,1,41,26-Mar-20,"Developed coastal areas often exhibit a strong systemic coupling between shoreline dynamics and economic dynamics. ""Beach nourishment"", a common erosion-control practice, involves mechanically depositing sediment from outside the local littoral system onto an actively eroding shoreline to alter shoreline morphology. Natural sediment-transport processes quickly rework the newly engineered beach, causing further changes to the shoreline that in turn affect subsequent beach-nourishment decisions. To the limited extent that this landscape/economic coupling has been considered, evidence suggests that towns tend to employ spatially myopic economic strategies under which individual towns make isolated decisions that do not account for their neighbors. What happens when an optimization strategy that explicitly ignores spatial interactions is incorporated into a physical model that is spatially dynamic? The long-term attractor that develops for the coupled system (the state and behavior to which the system evolves over time) is unclear. We link an economic model, in which town-manager agents choose economically optimal beach-nourishment intervals according to past observations of their immediate shoreline, to a simplified coastal-dynamics model that includes alongshore sediment transport and background erosion (e.g. from sea-level rise). Simulations suggest that feedbacks between these human and natural coastal processes can generate emergent behaviors. When alongshore sediment transport and spatially myopic nourishment decisions are coupled, increases in the rate of sea-level rise can destabilize economically optimal nourishment practices into a regime characterized by the emergence of chaotic shoreline evolution.",

Humans play a critical role in affecting such systems and in giving rise to various environmental consequences, which may in turn affect future human decisions and behavior. In light of complexity theory and its application in CHANS, this paper reviews various decision models used in agent based simulations of CHANS dynamics, discussing their strengths and weaknesses. This paper concludes by advocating development of more process-based decision models as well as protocols or architectures that facilitate better modeling of human decisions in various CHANS.",

Distribution models use environmental characteristics of observed distributions to determine the suite of conditions that allows invasion. Some variables are directly related to species’ biological needs, while others are surrogates that do not directly influence distributions. For aquatic invasive species (AIS) with calcified shells and exoskeletons, one common limiting factor is the chemical restriction on forming calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which is usually represented by conductivity or dissolved calcium. We predicted that conductivity and calcium would not serve as accurate surrogates for CaCO3 saturation state, which is more directly linked to calcification potential. To test this prediction, we fit classification trees to field surveys of northern Wisconsin lakes for three calcifying AIS—rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus), banded mystery snail (Viviparus georgianus), and Chinese mystery snail (Cipanguladina chinensis). Along with lake area, variables associated with calcification were the best predictors of species distributions. Even though saturation state is the most biologically mechanistic variable, it did not improve model predictions or explain more variability in species presence than its surrogates. Overall, surrogates are sufficient for species distribution modeling in these lakes that exhibit a wide range of chemical states.",

Fefferman",Physical Review E,3,,,19,,"The process of destroying a complex network through node removal has been the subject of extensive interest and research. Node loss typically leaves the network disintegrated into many small and isolated clusters. Here we show that these clusters typically remain close to each other and we suggest a simple algorithm that is able to reverse the inflicted damage by restoring the network's functionality. After damage, each node decides independently whether to create a new link depending on the fraction of neighbors it has lost. In addition to relying only on local information, where nodes do not need knowledge of the global network status, we impose the additional constraint that new links should be as short as possible (i.e. that the new edge completes a shortest possible new cycle). We demonstrate that this self-healing method operates very efficiently, both in model and real networks. For example, after removing the most connected airports in USA, the self-healing algorithm re-joined almost 90\% of the surviving airports.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10
