grant.2992741,410336,Optimal Land Development with Endogenous Environmental Amenities,2008,Wu and Irwin,American Journal Agricultural Economics,1,1,2,33,1Apr20,"A spatially explicit model of the optimal timing and location of land development is presented that incorporates dynamic interactions between land development and water quality. Ignoring two‐way interactions leads to a lower level of water quality, more development, and lower social welfare. The optimal pace and pattern of development can be achieved through the assessment of an impact fee that internalizes pollution damages and irreversibility costs. Our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for the spatial dimension of land use, the interdependence between land use and environmental quality, and development irreversibility in models of urbanization and amenity‐driven growth.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grant.2992741,410336,Spatial characteristics of exurban settlement pattern in the U.S,2009,Clark et al. ,Landscape and Urban Planning,3,3,3,134,2Apr20,"Despite pervasive exurban development in the United States (US) over the last several decades, a lack of relatively precise data has hindered basic research, including classification of the types of emerging exurban settlement patterns. But because exurbia transcends the traditional dichotomy of urban versus rural and metropolitan versus nonmetropolitan, standard census data are of limited value in analyzing these regions. To address this gap, we made use of a spatially explicit population database to indentify and examine the configuration of exurban settlement. We developed a multidimensional spatial patch index, which captures the variation exurban settlement across the landscape, along the lines of shape, size and contiguity typology of exurban patches. This index reveals substantial heterogeneity in fine-scale pattern not reflected by aggregate measures of exurban settlement density. Using this index, we then explored to what extent metropolitan characteristics commonly believed to influence urban decentralization also are associated with the configuration of decentralization. We find that while large, contiguous clumps of exurban settlement are correlated with these metropolitan characteristics, other exurban pattern types (such as isolated or linear patches) are not. Therefore, it appears that the factors that contribute to more urban decentralization may also lead to greater contiguity and concentration of exurban settlement. Additionally, we find that the processes that lead to isolated and dispersed exurban settlement may be different from those that foster contiguous, concentrated exurban settlement.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grant.2992741,410336,Spatial variance and spatial skewness: Leading indicators of regime shifts in spatial ecological systems,2009,Guttal and Jayaprakash,Theoretical Ecology,3,3,3,190,2Apr20,"Ecosystems can undergo large-scale changes in their states, known as catastrophic regime shifts, leading to substantial losses to services they provide to humans. These shifts occur rapidly and are difficult to predict. Several early warning signals of such transitions have recently been developed using simple models. These studies typically ignore spatial interactions, and the signal provided by these indicators may be ambiguous. We employ a simple model of collapse of vegetation in one and two spatial dimensions and show, using analytic and numerical studies, that increases in spatial variance and changes in spatial skewness occur as one approaches the threshold of vegetation collapse. We identify a novel feature, an increasing spatial variance in conjunction with a peaking of spatial skewness, as an unambiguous indicator of an impending regime shift. Once a signal has been detected, we show that a quick management action reducing the grazing activity is needed to prevent the collapse of vegetated state. Our results show that the difficulties in obtaining the accurate estimates of indicators arising due to lack of long temporal data can be alleviated when high-resolution spatially extended data are available. These results are shown to hold true independent of various details of model or different spatial dispersal kernels such as Gaussian or heavily fat tailed. This study suggests that spatial data and monitoring multiple indicators of regime shifts can play a key role in making reliable predictions on ecosystem stability and resilience.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These concerns are focused on exurban regions that may be largely rural, but fall within the shadow of urban and suburban areas and have experienced increasing transitions of land from rural to urban uses. For many years, researchers either ignored or dismissed exurban development,1 because data limitations hid its prevalence and because these outer areas contained relatively few people.

In this paper, we present a fully seasonal rainfall model that produces vegetation patterns found in nature by including the natural adaptation of plants to scarcity of water and the consequent seasonal variation in their growth and metabolic rate. We present results for the mean-field and spatially extended versions of the model. We find that the patterns depend on the duration of the wet season even with fixed total annual precipitation (PPT) showing how seasonality affects spatial self-organization. We observe that the productivity can vary for fixed PPT as a function of the duration thereby providing another source of observed variations. We compute the maximum vegetation cover as function of PPT and find that the behavior is consistent with observations. We comment on the implications for regime shifts due to increased interannual fluctuations caused by climatic changes. Our specific model calculations provide more general conclusions for ecosystems with competition for scarce resources due to seasonal variations in the resource, especially for self-organization and productivity.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

grant.2992741,410336,A two-dimensional ecological model of Lake Erie: Application to estimate dreissenid impacts on large lake plankton populations,2008,Zhang et al. ,Ecological Modelling,2,3,3,89,2Apr20,"We constructed a complex ecological model of Lake Erie, EcoLE, based on a two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model (CE-QUAL-W2). We used data from 1997 to calibrate the model, and data from 1998 and 1999 to verify it. The simulated surface and bottom water temperatures show good agreement with field observations. In spite of limitations of this 2D model and data availability, the simulated values of biological and nutrient state variables match well with field measurements. Although EcoLE's performance for the verification years is as good as that of the calibration year, the wide standard deviations of both field measurements and model simulations as well as the complexity of an ecosystem of this size make us consider our model more as a valid analytical tool rather than a predictive one at this moment. Nevertheless, we have constructed the first fine-scale dynamic ecological model of a large lake that couples hydrodynamics and detailed food web of lower trophic levels and is driven by real-time air temperature and wind conditions and the inputs from the atmosphere and tributaries. Using the model we investigate the impacts of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussels (D. bugensis) on phytoplankton of Lake Erie. The simulation results show that dreissenid grazing impacts on non-diatom edible algae (NDEA) are weakened by the boundary layer above the basin bottom. However, dreissenid grazing impacts on diatoms are less affected by the boundary layer due to the higher sinking rates of diatoms. Dreissenid mussels increase non-diatom inedible algae (NDIA) rapidly with increasing mussel population size, because the dreissenid population excretes a large amount of ammonia and phosphate. Our results indicate that dreissenid mussels have weak direct grazing impacts on algal biomass, while indirect effects of their nutrient excretion have a greater impact on the system.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grant.2992741,410336,Vertical mixing and weak stratification overe zebra mussel colonies in western Lake Erie,2008,Boegman et al. ,Limnology and Oceanography,2,3,3,86,1Apr20,"Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are an invasive species that
 have been implicated in the reduction of algae stocks in the near‐shore
 environment of western Lake Erie. To determine their basin‐wide 
effects, we applied a two‐dimensional  hydrodynamic and water‐quality 
model for 1994. The model accurately reproduced lake‐wide hydrodynamics 
and water quality. When modeled as true benthic organisms (resting on 
the bottom), the dreissenids grazed 53% of the western basin May through
 September net algal growth. This grazing resulted in a ~0.1‐mg L‐1
 reduction in the pelagic algae concentration relative to the case 
without dreissenids. In comparison, dreissenids grazed 77% western basin
 net algal growth when the lake was modeled as a fully mixed water 
column. We found that the biomass grazed was governed by a balance 
between the timescales of vertical wind‐induced mixing and benthic 
grazing. During calm conditions, weak diurnal stratification (~1°C 
between surface and bottom waters) was sufficient to suppress vertical 
mixing, when the mean daily wind speed 4 m above the lake surface (U4) was ~6 m s‐1
 . These conditions allowed a concentration boundary layer ~1 m thick to
 form, accounting for the reduced grazing effect relative to the fully 
mixed case. Entrainment of the concentration boundary layer occurred for
 U4>6 m s‐1  (associated with the lake's characteristic 
10‐d storm cycle) facilitating algae supply to the benthos. We 
formulated the mean daily biomass grazed in terms of the dreissenid areal pumping rate (a) and U4 and found that because typically U4 is ~6 m s‐1 , the western basin is weakly stratified thermally and a concentration boundary layer forms when U4<3α or α>2 m3 m‐2 d‐1
 . The dynamics of both wind‐mixing and thermal stratification must, 
therefore, be considered in mixing models applied to shallow weakly

Anadromous salmon transport marine‐derived nutrients and carbon to freshwater and riparian ecosystems upon their return to natal spawning systems. The ecological implications of these subsidies on the trophic ecology of resident fish remain poorly understood despite broad recognition of their potential importance. 2. We studied the within‐year changes in the ration size, composition and stable isotope signature of the diets of two resident salmonids (rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss; Arctic grayling, Thymallus arcticus) before and after the arrival of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) to their spawning grounds in the Bristol Bay region of southwest Alaska. 3. Ration size and energy intake increased by 480–620% for both species after salmon arrived. However, the cause of the increases differed between species such that rainbow trout switched to consuming salmon eggs, salmon flesh and blowflies that colonized salmon carcasses, whereas grayling primarily ate more benthic invertebrates that were presumably made available because of physical disturbances by spawning salmon. 4. We also observed an increase in the δ15N of rainbow trout diets post‐salmon, but not for grayling. This presumably led to the observed increase in the δ15N of rainbow trout with increasing body mass, but not for grayling. 5. Using a bioenergetics model, we predicted that salmon‐derived resources contributed a large majority of the energy necessary for growth in this resident fish community. Furthermore, the bioenergetics model also showed how seasonal changes in diet affected the stable isotope ratios of both species.

",Transactions of the American Fisheries Society,3,3,3,28,26Mar20,"A large and growing body of literature has documented the transfer of marine‐derived nutrients from the ocean to freshwater and riparian systems by semelparous Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. The pathways by which these nutrients reach resident fish are often indirect, and the evidence for direct benefits to the resident fish is not always conclusive. However, the consumption of salmon tissue (in one form or another) by resident fish would constitute a direct and efficient pathway for energy transfer. We studied a population of small‐bodied, nonanadromous Dolly Varden Salvelinus malma feeding on the fry and eggs of sockeye salmon O. nerka and blowfly (family Calliphoridae) larvae that had fed on salmon carcasses at a series of spring‐fed and otherwise unproductive ponds in southwestern Alaska. The Dolly Varden fed heavily on sockeye salmon fry when available, shifted their diet almost exclusively to eggs after salmon spawning commenced, and then shifted to blowfly larvae toward the end of the season. Dolly Varden large enough to eat eggs moved into ponds where sockeye salmon spawn synchronously with the arrival of the salmon, and Dolly Varden growth rates increased greatly once salmon eggs and blowfly maggots were available. Young‐of‐the‐year Dolly Varden, which were too small to eat eggs and fry, were concentrated in small streams between ponds where fewer sockeye salmon spawn, perhaps to minimize the risk of predation from larger conspecifics. These results indicate the importance of a pulse of salmon‐related food resources for this population of resident fish and their adaptations to take advantage of these resources. It is likely that similar dependence occurs in other systems where sockeye salmon produce a suite of temporally predictable energy resources; thus, resident fish may depend on large populations of salmon.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depending on the selective pressures, the individuals that stay may be larger, smaller or similar in size to those that move. Freshwater movements of juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka Walbaum) fry vary among and within populations, and can be complex, especially in interconnected lake systems. We examined variation of movement patterns by a sockeye salmon population in an interconnected lake system during a period of rapid natural habitat change and found that fry migrating downstream were shorter, had lower body condition, and were more likely ill and moribund compared with fish remaining in the lake. However, otolith microstructure measurements indicated that emigrants did not grow significantly slower than residents prior to downstream movement. We show that patterns (i.e., demography of migrants, timing of movement) of downstream movement have changed since the 1970s, corresponding to changes in rearing habitat. Our findings parallel the results with other salmonid species and are generally consistent with the paradigm that density‐dependent interactions from declining habitat availability or quality result in the downstream movement of competitively inferior individuals, although the mechanisms governing downstream migration are unclear in this system.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the context dependency of these types of impacts remains challenging. For example, organisms may perform different functions at different densities. Anadromous salmon accumulate > 99% of their lifetime growth in marine ecosystems, and then return to spawn, often at high densities, in relatively confined freshwaters. While previous research has focused on how salmon nutrients can fertilize benthic communities, we examined how an ecosystem engineer, sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka, influences seasonal dynamics of stream benthic communities through their nest‐digging activities in south‐western Alaska, USA. Benthic invertebrate and algal abundance were quantified every 7–14 days during the open water seasons of 10 streams in riffle and run habitats across multiple years, leading to 25 different stream‐year combinations that spanned a large gradient of salmon density. In streams with few or no salmon, benthic algal and insect biomass were fairly constant throughout the season. However, in streams with more than 0·1 salmon m−2, algal and insect biomass decreased by an average of 75–85% during salmon spawning. Algal biomass recovered quickly following salmon disturbance, occasionally reaching pre‐salmon biomass. In contrast, in streams with more than 0·1 salmon m−2, aquatic insect populations did not recover to pre‐salmon levels within the same season. We observed no positive impacts of salmon on algae or insects via fertilization from carcass nutrients. Salmon, when their populations exceed thresholds in spawning density, are an important component of stream disturbance regimes and influence seasonal dynamics of benthic communities. Human activities that drive salmon densities below threshold densities, as has likely happened in many streams, will lead to altered seasonal dynamics of stream communities. Human activities that alter animal populations that are sources of biogenic disturbance can result in shifts in community dynamics.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grant.2992744,410437,A metapopulation perspective for salmon and other anadromous fish,2007,"Schtickzelle, N; Quinn, TP.",FISH AND FISHERIES,3,2,1,102,26Mar20,"Salmonids are an important component of biodiversity, culture and economy in several regions, particularly the North Pacific Rim. Given this importance, they have been intensively studied for about a century, and the pioneering scientists recognized the critical link between population structure and conservation. Spatial structure is indeed of prime importance for salmon conservation and management. At first glance, the essence of the metapopulation concept, i.e. a population of populations, widely used on other organisms like butterflies, seems to be particularly relevant to salmon, and more generally to anadromous fish. Nevertheless, the concept is rarely used, and barely tested. Here, we present a metapopulation perspective for anadromous fish, assessing in terms of processes rather than of patterns the set of necessary conditions for metapopulation dynamics to exist. Salmon, and particularly sockeye salmon in Alaska, are used as an illustrative case study. A review of life history traits indicates that the three basic conditions are likely to be fulfilled by anadromous salmon: (i) the spawning habitat is discrete and populations are spatially separated by unsuitable habitat; (ii) some asynchrony is present in the dynamics of more or less distant populations and (iii) dispersal links populations because some salmon stray from their natal population. The implications of some peculiarities of salmon life history traits, unusual in classical metapopulations, are also discussed. Deeper understanding of the population structure of anadromous fish will be advanced by future studies on specific topics: (i) criteria must be defined for the delineation of suitable habitats that are based on features of the biotope and not on the presence of fish; (ii) the collection of long‐term data and the development of improved methods to determine age structure are essential for correctly estimating levels of asynchrony between populations and (iii) several key aspects of dispersal are still poorly understood and need to be examined in detail: the spatial and temporal scales of dispersal movements, the origin and destination populations instead of simple straying rates, and the relative reproductive success of immigrants and residents.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Worm et al.(3 Nov. 2006, p. 787) projects that 100 of seafood-producing species stocks will collapse by 2048. The projection is inaccurate and overly pessimistic. Worm et al. define collapse as occurring when the current year's catch is <10 of the highest observed in a stock's time series. However, fish catch is rarely an adequate proxy for fish abundance, particularly for rebuilding stocks under management. A variety of biological, economic, and social factors and management decisions determine catches; low catches may occur even when stocks are high (e.g., due to low fish prices or the effects of restrictive management practices), and vice versa. The inadequacy of Worm et al.'s abundance proxy is illustrated by the time series of data for Georges Bank haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus). The highest catch for haddock occurred in 1965 at 150,362 tons (1). This catch occurred during a period of intense domestic and international fishing (1). In 2003, haddock catch was 12,576 tons, or 8 of the time series maximum. Under the Worm et al. definition, the stock would be categorized as collapsed in 2003. However, stock assessment data (1) estimate the total magnitude of the spawning biomass in 2003 to be 91 of that in 1965. Comparing the estimate of spawning stock biomass in 2003 to the level producing maximum sustainable yield (MSY), the stock was not even being overfished in 2003 (2). Because adequate stock abundance measures exist for only a portion of world fish stocks, this purported worldwide meta analysis required using data that represent the lowest common denominator of datathe total magnitude of the catch. However, if the catch ratio metric is so prone to misrepresentation of the true status of populations, as illustrated above, a synthesis of world fisheries based on these data is equally flawed. At the least, the authors should have conducted a calibration of their stock collapse metric with more complete stock abundance data available from the many worldwide sources where such data exist.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In different fisheries incentive systems have been found to reduce the race‐for‐fish and make fisheries profitable, to stimulate stock rebuilding, to reduce bycatch, and to provide for reductions in illegal fishing. Yet, success can be evaluated in many dimensions, but is, in fact, rarely done – per cent overfished seems to be the dominant measure of performance. I evaluate the yield lost due to overfishing in several ecosystems and contrast the situation of North Atlantic cod where considerable yield is lost, to fisheries in New Zealand and the west coast of the USA where lost yield due to overfishing is very small. Much more systematic evaluation of the other aspects of fisheries performance is greatly needed.

In all cases, fishing fleets behave rationally within the imposed regulatory structures. Successful, generalist fishermen who take risks often pioneer developing fisheries. At this stage, regulations and subsidies tend to encourage excessive entry and investments, creating the potential for serial depletion. In mature fisheries, regulations often restrict season length, vessel and gear types, fishing areas, and fleet size, causing or exacerbating the race for fish and excessive investment, and are typically unsuccessful except when combined with dedicated access privileges (e.g., territorial rights, individual quotas). In senescent fisheries, vessel buyback programs must account for the fishing power of individuals and their vessels. Subsidies should be avoided as they prolong the transition towards alternative employment.

Monitoring land change at multiple spatial scales is essential for identifying hotspots of change, and for developing and implementing policies for conserving biodiversity and habitats. In the high diversity country of Colombia, these types of analyses are difficult because there is no consistent wall-to-wall, multi-temporal dataset for land-use and land-cover change.

Methodology/Principal Findings
To address this problem, we mapped annual land-use and land-cover from 2001 to 2010 in Colombia using MODIS (250 m) products coupled with reference data from high spatial resolution imagery (QuickBird) in Google Earth. We used QuickBird imagery to visually interpret percent cover of eight land cover classes used for classifier training and accuracy assessment. Based on these maps we evaluated land cover change at four spatial scales country, biome, ecoregion, and municipality. Of the 1,117 municipalities, 820 had a net gain in woody vegetation (28,092 km2) while 264 had a net loss (11,129 km2), which resulted in a net gain of 16,963 km2 in woody vegetation at the national scale. Woody regrowth mainly occurred in areas previously classified as mixed woody/plantation rather than agriculture/herbaceous. The majority of this gain occurred in the Moist Forest biome, within the montane forest ecoregions, while the greatest loss of woody vegetation occurred in the Llanos and Apure-Villavicencio ecoregions.

Conclusions
The unexpected forest recovery trend, particularly in the Andes, provides an opportunity to expand current protected areas and to promote habitat connectivity. Furthermore, ecoregions with intense land conversion (e.g. Northern Andean Páramo) and ecoregions under-represented in the protected area network (e.g. Llanos, Apure-Villavicencio Dry forest, and Magdalena-Urabá Moist forest ecoregions) should be considered for new protected areas.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the calling activity of the common tink frog Diasporus diastema (Eleutherodactylidae) in 12 secondary forest sites that vary in age of recovery, and three old growth sites in the Caribbean of Costa Rica. We used visual and acoustic surveys along transects, and we identified only 26 individuals in a total of 12 hours of censuses for each site. We also used automated species identification from recordings, and we detected D. diastema in 10,605 of 49,273 recordings. The peak of the daily calling activity occurred from 2100h to 0100h, and the peak of monthly activity occurred in May. Calling activity did not vary among the different forest sites, suggesting that secondary forests can provide suitable habitat for D. diastema reproduction.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing global food demand (particularly in Southeast Asia) accelerates deforestation in areas suitable for modern agriculture (e.g., soybean), severely threatening ecosystems, such as Amazonian rain forests, dry forests, and subtropical grasslands. Additionally, in the coming decades, demand for biofuels may become an emerging threat. In contrast, high yields in modern agricultural systems and rural–urban migration coupled with remittances promote the abandonment of marginal agricultural lands, thus favoring ecosystem recovery on mountains, deserts, and areas of poor soils, while improving human well-being. The potential switch from production in traditional extensive grazing areas to intensive modern agriculture provides opportunities to significantly increase food production while sparing land for nature conservation. This combination of emerging threats and opportunities requires changes in the way the conservation of Latin American ecosystems is approached. Land-use efficiency should be analyzed beyond the local-based paradigm that drives most conservation programs, and focus on large geographic scales involving long-distance fluxes of products, information, and people in order to maximize both agricultural production and the conservation of environmental services.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",Ecology and Society,1,1,1,119,20Apr20,"For many years, tropical and subtropical forests have been deforested for agriculture, grazing, and timber extraction. Nevertheless in the last decade, several publications have suggested that some regions of Latin America are showing a process of forest transition. Forest transition theory predicts that industrialization and urbanization will lead to the abandonment of marginal agriculture lands and the recovery of natural systems such as forests. However, there are many ecological, economic, and social factors that could act as barriers to ecosystem recovery. To evaluate this hypothesis, we analyzed the socioeconomic and land-use changes during the last 30 years at the provincial and departmental level in the province of Misiones, Argentina. We described the changes in the distribution of urban and rural populations based on national population censuses from 1970, 1980, 1991, and 2001. Land-use change was based on a supervised analysis of four mosaics of Landsat Multispectral Scanner and Thematic Mapper satellite images from 1973, 1979, 1987/1989, and 2006. Although the change in the rural population varied greatly among the departments, there has been a dramatic increase in the urban population at the provincial level. The major land-use changes between 1973 and 2006 were an increase in monospecific plantations of mainly Pinus and Eucalyptus of 2702 km² and a loss of 4689 km² of natural forest. Misiones possesses the largest remnant of continuous Atlantic Forest, which is famous for its high level of biodiversity and endemism, but much of this forest now comprises monospecific plantations. Although demographic changes in Misiones are similar to those that have occurred other regions (i.e., rural–urban migration), and the increase in forest plantations helps to maintain forest cover, this cover has much lower ecological value than that of natural forest. To ensure the conservation of the high-diversity Atlantic Forest in Misiones requires a better effort to understand the interactions among the diverse factors that affect land-use patterns in this region.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We created future land-use-cover scenarios based on human demographic parameters and the relationship between rural population and land-cover change between 1970 and 2006. In 2006, native forest covered 50% of the province, but by 2030 all scenarios predicted a decrease that ranged from 18 to 39% forest cover. Between 1970 and 2001, rural migrants represented 20% of urban population growth and are expected to represent less than 10% by 2030.

The pan‐tropical geography of forest change is a challenge to assess, and improved estimates of the human footprint in the tropics are critical to understanding potential changes in biodiversity. We combined recently published and new satellite observations, along with images from Google Earth and a literature review, to estimate the contemporary global extent of deforestation, selective logging, and secondary regrowth in humid tropical forests. Roughly 1.4% of the biome was deforested between 2000 and 2005. As of 2005, about half of the humid tropical forest biome contained 50% or less tree cover. Although not directly comparable to deforestation, geographic estimates of selective logging indicate that at least 20% of the humid tropical forest biome was undergoing some level of timber harvesting between 2000 and 2005. Forest recovery estimates are even less certain, but a compilation of available reports suggests that at least 1.2% of the humid tropical forest biome was in some stage of long‐term secondary regrowth in 2000. Nearly 70% of the regrowth reports indicate forest regeneration in hilly, upland, and mountainous environments considered marginal for large‐scale agriculture and ranching. Our estimates of the human footprint are conservative because they do not resolve very small‐scale deforestation, low‐intensity logging, and unreported secondary regrowth, nor do they incorporate other impacts on tropical forest ecosystems, such as fire and hunting. Our results highlight the enormous geographic extent of forest change throughout the humid tropics and the considerable limitations of the science and technology available for such a synthesis.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Changes in habitat and landscape characteristics due to land-use change can have a significant effect on species presence, abundance, and distribution. Multi-scale approaches have been used to determine the proper spatial scales at which species and communities are responding to habitat transformation. In this context, we evaluated medium and large mammal species richness and composition in gallery forest (n = 10), grassland (n = 10), and exotic tree plantation (n = 10) in a region where grasslands have been converted into exotic tree plantations. We quantified mammal species richness and composition with camera traps and track surveys. The composition of the mammal community was related with local habitat variables, and landscape variables measured at seven spatial scales. We found 14 mammal species in forest, 11 species in plantation, and 7 mammal species in grassland. Two species are exotics, the wild boar Sus scrofa Linnaeus, 1758 and the European hare Lepus europaeus Pallas, 1778. The most common species are the crab-eating fox Cerdocyon thous Linnaeus, 1766, the nine-banded armadillo Dasypus novemcinctus Linnaeus, 1758 and the gray brocket deer Mazama gouazoubira G. Fischer, 1814 which are generalist species. Our results showed significant differences in mammal species richness and composition among the three habitat types. Plantations can have positive and negative effects on the presence of species restricted to grasslands. Positive effects are reflected in a wider local distribution of some forest species that rarely use grassland. The most important habitat and landscape variables that influenced mammal species richness and composition were vertical structure index, canopy cover, tree species diversity, percentage of grass, and the percentage of forest and grassland at the landscape scale of 0.1 km. We advise the following important measures for conservation of this mammal community: 1) reduce logging and cattle grazing in gallery forest, and 2) increase grassland buffer zones between plantation and forest.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In countries with a high population density and relatively high levels of education, the globalization process has resulted in a shift in the local economy from agriculture to manufacturing, technology, and service sectors. This shift in the economy has impacted land-use dynamics by decreasing agricultural lands, increasing urban growth, and in some cases, increasing forest cover. This process of economic and forest transition has been well documented in Puerto Rico for the period 1950 to 1990, but some authors predicted that poor planning and continued urban growth would eliminate the gains in forest cover. To investigate the impacts of recent economic changes, we evaluated demographic and land-use changes for 880 “barrios” (i.e., neighborhoods), the smallest administrative unit, in Puerto Rico using government census data from 1990 and 2000 and land-cover classifications from 1991 and 2000. During this period, the population increased by 284 127 people (8.2%). Most of the growth was in the suburban barrios, whereas urban barrios lost population. This shift was reflected by the construction of more than 100 000 housing units in suburban barrios. Although urban sprawl is perceived as the major land-cover change, urban cover only increased from 10% to 11% between 1990 and 2000, whereas the increase in forest cover was much greater (28% to 40%). Grasslands and shrublands were the major sources of new urban and forest areas in 2000. Although these results are encouraging in terms of increasing forest cover, most of the new development has been concentrated in the coastal plains, which are the location of most of the remaining agricultural areas, a few protected areas, and threatened ecosystems (e.g., mangroves).",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis covered two periods: 1949–1972 and 1972–2006 using remote sensing techniques. For the year 2001, we mapped the patterns of distribution of secondary forests dominated by the most abundant exotic tree species (Ligustrum lucidum). Based on land-cover maps, we estimated sediment yield as an index of watershed condition. Urban area was growing during the whole study period. Between 1949 and 2006, forest area increased approximately 1400 ha, mostly over abandoned agriculture and grasslands; this expansion was accelerated between 1972 and 2006. Increased forest cover resulted in a reduction in erosion and sediment yield that was disproportionately large, as most new forests are located in areas of steep slopes and high rainfall. By 2001, Ligustum-dominated forests had expanded to more than 500 ha, in the southern portion of the sierra only. Overall, the analysis quantifies a process of Neotropical periurban forest transition, likely associated with socioeconomic changes related to population urbanization, that promotes improvements of some environmental services, such as watershed and biodiversity conservation.

As examples, remittances from distant migrants may alter consumption patterns within sending communities, while exposure to different cultural norms may alter other behaviors. This paper combines these insights to offer a unique lens on migration’s environmental impact. From an environmental perspective, we ask the following question: is the likely rise in consumption brought about by remittances counterbalanced by a reduction in fertility in migrant households following exposure to lower fertility cultures? Based on ethnographic case studies in two western highland Guatemalan communities, we argue that the near-term rise in consumption due to remittances is not counterbalanced by rapid decline in migrant household fertility. However, over time, the environmental cost of consumption may be mitigated at the community level through diffusion of contraception and family planning norms yielding lower family size.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet modeling efforts applied to coupled human–natural systems seemingly favor models assuming continuous spatial relationships. We examine the relative importance of place-based hierarchical versus spatial clustering influences in tropical land use/cover change (LUCC). Guatemala was chosen as our study site given its high rural population growth and deforestation in recent decades. We test predictors of 2009 forest cover and forest cover change from 2001 to 2009 across Guatemala's 331 municipalities and 22 departments using spatial and multi-level statistical models. Our results indicate the emergence of several socio-economic predictors of LUCC regardless of model choice. Hierarchical model results suggest that significant differences exist at the municipal and departmental levels but largely maintain the magnitude and direction of single-level model coefficient estimates. They are also intervention-relevant since policies tend to be applicable to distinct political units rather than to continuous space. Spatial models complement hierarchical approaches by indicating where and to what magnitude significant negative and positive clustering associations emerge. Appreciating the comparative advantages and limitations of spatial and nested models enhances a holistic approach to geographical analysis of tropical LUCC and human–environment interactions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this challenge, we have developed a cost-effective mapping procedure based on 250-m MODIS imagery that produces annual land-use/land-cover (LULC) maps for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). This procedure uses annual spectral statistics, collection of references samples with a Web-based tool, and tree-based Random Forests classifiers stratified by biome map regions to produce wall-to-wall, annual LULC maps for 2001 to 2010 that cover all of LAC. Across 26 map regions, overall pixel-level accuracy averaged 80.2 ± 8.1% for eight basic LULC classes, and 84.6 ± 6.5% for a five-class scheme. Municipality-scale area change between 2001 and 2010 in the three dominant classes (woody vegetation, mixed woody/plantation, and agriculture/herbaceous vegetation) was then estimated using regression models fit to 10 years of data, thus minimizing the impact of inter-annual class variation on change statistics. Closed-canopy forest area and change between 2001 and 2009 were well correlated with high-resolution maps of the Brazilian Legal Amazon (PRODES project). Our LAC-wide analysis of significant change revealed the recent extent and magnitude of deforestation hotspots, such as in the Amazon moist forests and the dry forests of Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia. Our data also revealed biome-specific clusters of municipalities with increasing woody vegetation due to forest recovery, reforestation, or woody encroachment. Taken as a whole, our MODIS-based mapping and trend modeling methodology can provide reliable land change data, not just for the tropics or for forest cover, but for all biomes and municipalities in LAC and including multiple LULC classes. Because this information can be produced quickly on an annual time scale, with internally-consistent data sources, it is a very useful tool for resource managers, policy makers, scientists and conservationists interested in tracking recent land change across broad-scale, political and environmental gradients.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

However, our knowledge of FT from tropical regions is mostly derived from case studies from within a particular country, making it difficult to generalize findings across larger regions. Here we overcome these difficulties by conducting a recent (2001–2010) satellite-based analysis of trends in forest cover across Central America, stratified by biomes, which we related to socioeconomic variables associated with human development. Results show a net decrease of woody vegetation resulting from 12,201 km2 of deforestation of moist forests and 6,825 km2 of regrowth of conifer and dry forests. The Human Development Index was the socioeconomic variable best associated with forest cover change. The least-developed countries, Nicaragua and Guatemala, experienced both rapid deforestation of moist forests and significant recovery of conifer and dry forests. In contrast, the most developed countries, Panama and Costa Rica, had net woody vegetation gain and a more stable forest cover configuration. These results imply a good agreement with FT predictions of forest change in relation to socioeconomic development, but strong asymmetry in rates and directions of change largely dependent upon the biome where change is occurring. The FT model should be refined by incorporating ecological and socioeconomic heterogeneity, particularly in multicountry and regional studies.

We present a method to map annual LULC at a regional spatial scale with source data and processing techniques that permit scaling to broader spatial and temporal scales, while maintaining a consistent classification scheme and accuracy. Using the Dry Chaco ecoregion in Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay as a test site, we derived a suite of predictor variables from 2001 to 2007 from the MODIS 250 m vegetation index product (MOD13Q1). These variables included: annual statistics of red, near infrared, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), phenological metrics derived from EVI time series data, and slope and elevation. For reference data, we visually interpreted percent cover of eight classes at locations with high-resolution QuickBird imagery in Google Earth. An adjustable majority cover threshold was used to assign samples to a dominant class. When compared to field data, we found this imagery to have georeferencing error < 5% the length of a MODIS pixel, while most class interpretation error was related to confusion between agriculture and herbaceous vegetation. We used the Random Forests classifier to identify the best sets of predictor variables and percent cover thresholds for discriminating our LULC classes. The best variable set included all predictor variables and a cover threshold of 80%. This optimal Random Forests was used to map LULC for each year between 2001 and 2007, followed by a per-pixel, 3-year temporal filter to remove disallowed LULC transitions. Our sequence of maps had an overall accuracy of 79.3%, producer accuracy from 51.4% (plantation) to 95.8% (woody vegetation), and user accuracy from 58.9% (herbaceous vegetation) to 100.0% (water). We attributed map class confusion to limited spectral information, sub-pixel spectral mixing, georeferencing error and human error in interpreting reference samples. We used our maps to assess woody vegetation change in the Dry Chaco from 2002 to 2006, which was characterized by rapid deforestation related to soybean and planted pasture expansion. This method can be easily applied to other regions or continents to produce spatially and temporally consistent information on annual LULC.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Demographic change, in particular, is thought to be a major driver of forest change. Most studies have evaluated these interactions at the regional or the national level, but few studies have evaluated these dynamics across multiple spatial scales within a country. In this study, we evaluated the effect of demographic, environmental, and socioeconomic variables on land-cover change between 2001 and 2010 for all Mexican municipalities (n = 2,443) as well as by biome (n = 4). We used a land-cover classification based on 250-m MODIS data to examine the change in cover classes (i.e., woody, mixed woody, and agriculture/herbaceous vegetation). We evaluated the trends of land-cover change and identified the major factors correlated with woody vegetation change in Mexico. At the national scale, the variation in woody vegetation was best explained by environmental variables, particularly precipitation; municipalities where woody cover increased tended to be in areas with low average annual precipitation (i.e., desert and dry forest biomes). Demographic variables did not contribute much to the model at the national scale. Elevation, temperature, and population density explained the change in woody cover when municipalities were grouped by biome (i.e., moist forest, dry forest, coniferous forest, and deserts). Land-cover change at the biome level showed two main trends: (1) the tropical moist biome lost woody vegetation to agriculture and herbaceous vegetation, and (2) the desert biome increased in woody vegetation within more open-canopy shrublands.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

",2012,Redo et al. ,Environmental Conservation ,1,1,1,27,16Apr20,"Policies play a pivotal role in determining land change. Uruguay has been subject to first a rise and then decline in plantations of exotic trees as a result of internal Uruguayan government policies, and a recent substantial increase in soybean cultivation that may be attributed to Argentinean policies. To properly assess the relationship between land change and changes in land-use policies, vegetation change for Uruguay from 2001 to 2009 was mapped using MODIS imagery. Between 2001 and 2009, the area covered by exotic tree plantations declined by 1435 km2, and 34 681 km2 of herbaceous cover was converted to agricultural cover, mainly soybean cultivation. Uruguay and Argentina implemented land-use policy changes following the 2002 economic collapse. Rapid increase in exotic tree plantations, mainly in the 1990s, may have been stimulated by Uruguayan government incentives, while their recent decline coincides with the subsequent elimination of these incentives. The rapid increase in soybean production may be largely attributed to recent tax regimes in Argentina and lack of export tax in Uruguay combining to provide a favourable financial climate for Uruguayan soybean cultivation. Soybean cultivation is predicted to continue to expand in Uruguay, while exotic tree plantations should also increase in importance owing to the recent establishment of the world's largest pulp mill.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Yet, we know very little about the dynamics of land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) in these understudied regions. Our objective is to map vegetation change in Brazil’s three largest dryland ecoregions – the Cerrado, Caatinga, and Mato Grosso seasonal forests – using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data from 2001 to 2009 at the scale of the municipality. We then assess the relationship between changes in land use and land cover and changes in crop and animal production and environmental factors using random forest regression. Although deforestation is still the dominant transition in Mato Grosso, portions of the Cerrado and Caatinga are experiencing a return of woody vegetation. Other agricultural production systems such as sugarcane also play a key role in vegetation change dynamics, besides soybean and cattle ranching. Municipalities with low standard deviations of temperature, high annual precipitation totals, and low elevation are most likely to have undergone deforestation from 2001 to 2009. In the Cerrado, sugarcane is positively associated with woody regrowth, but these changes may be resulting in displacement deforestation in Mato Grosso. Increases in rainfall and the decline of agriculture were responsible for the return of woody vegetation in the Caatinga.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Much of the discussion has been centered on the two main forms of tenure regime: common-pool system and private property. Case studies around the world have provided evidence on whether one is more effective at preventing deforestation than the other, but there is not a clear pattern. Part of the problem is that evidence comes from theoretical models or isolated case studies instead of comparative studies across large areas. This paper helps to fill this gap by analyzing the association between land cover change (2001–2010) and land tenure regimes including private and two types of common-pool systems (communal and ejido) in Mexico at the municipality level. The analyses were conducted for each of the four major biomes (i.e., moist forest, dry forest, coniferous forest, and desert) to control for differences in environmental factors. Municipalities dominated by communal land tenure had the largest increase in woody cover (classified as >80% cover) in the moist forest, dry forest, and coniferous forest biomes, and municipalities classified as private also had an increase in woody cover, particularly in the desert biome. In contrast, municipalities classified as ejidos (common-pool tenure system resulting from the land reform) lost woody cover mostly in moist forest and desert biomes, but gained woody cover in dry forest and coniferous forest biomes. In modeling analyses, environmental variables were the most important variables associated with woody cover change for private and most communal municipalities, while socioeconomic variables were the most important in ejido regimes. These results highlight the importance of land tenure on land cover change, and show that differences in woody cover change between types of common-pool systems can be larger than their differences with private land tenure. During the last 10 years, virtually all deforestation has occurred in areas dominated by ejidos; in contrast, communal and private regimes seem to ameliorate the deforestation process.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

It also explores the theoretical dimensions surrounding the debate over the relative importance of socioeconomic and environmental variables in explaining land change. Results from the land change analysis show several hotspots of dynamic change. The majority of woody vegetation loss occurred in the eastern lowlands of Santa Cruz, Beni, and Pando and was attributable to the expansion of industrial agriculture. Gains in woody vegetation took place in the drylands of Santa Cruz and Beni savanna, and these changes were attributed to shifting patterns in precipitation and fire rather than human-induced change. Other hotspots of woody vegetation gain were attributed to abandonment of agriculture and herbaceous lands in the intermontane valleys of the southern Andes. Regression analyses showed that population and other demographic variables were poor predictors of land change. There is a clear relationship, however, between changes in woody and agriculture/herbaceous vegetation and environmental variables such as precipitation, temperature, and elevation. Municipalities with adequate precipitation and moderate temperature tended to show increases in agriculture and herbaceous vegetation and woody vegetation declines. Woody vegetation tended to increase in municipalities at higher elevations. This study also shows that explanations of only wealth or population as the main drivers of land change undervalue the role that natural features, like topography and precipitation, play in limiting or permitting certain land-use decisions.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Our study was conducted in China's Wolong Nature Reserve, home to the world-famous endangered giant pandas and >4,500 farmers. We found that, in addition to conservation payment amounts and program duration, social norms at the neighborhood level had significant impacts on program re-enrollment, suggesting that social norms can be used to leverage participation to enhance the sustainability of conservation benefits from PES programs.

If divorced households had combined to have the same average household size as married households, there could have been 7.4 million fewer households in these countries. Meanwhile, the number of rooms per person in divorced households was 33–95% greater than in married households. In the United States (U.S.) in 2005, divorced households spent 46% and 56% more on electricity and water per person than married households. Divorced households in the U.S. could have saved more than 38 million rooms, 73 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, and 627 billion gallons of water in 2005 alone if their resource-use efficiency had been comparable to married households.

Theoretically, support for conservation from the various types of stakeholder inside and outside protected areas is maximized if stakeholders benefit proportionally to the opportunity costs they bear. The disproportional benefit distribution among stakeholders can erode their support for or lead to the failure of ecotourism and conservation. Using Wolong Nature Reserve for Giant Pandas (China) as an example, we demonstrate two types of uneven distribution of economic benefits among four major groups of stakeholders. First, a significant inequality exists between the local rural residents and the other types of stakeholder. The rural residents are the primary bearers of the cost of conservation, but the majority of economic benefits (investment, employment, and goods) in three key ecotourism sectors (infrastructural construction, hotels/restaurants, and souvenir sales) go to other stakeholders. Second, results show that the distribution of economic benefits is unequal among the rural residents inside the reserve. Most rural households that benefit from ecotourism are located near the main road and potentially have less impact on panda habitat than households far from the road and closer to panda habitats. This distribution gap is likely to discourage conservation support from the latter households, whose activities are the main forces degrading panda habitats. We suggest that the unequal distribution of the benefits from ecotourism can be lessened by enhancing local participation, increasing the use of local goods, and encouraging relocation of rural households closer to ecotourism facilities.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated giant panda use of habitat by observing the presence/absence of panda feces in 913 field plots. Newly harvested areas (0–10 years) had the lowest frequency of feces presence (3%), while unharvested forests had the highest (36%). Feces presence is influenced by bamboo cover, overstory and midstory composition, slope, aspect and distance to human activity. Results suggest that timber harvesting and fuelwood collection have important impacts on the use of forested habitats and panda use is reduced for several decades after harvests. However, as the forest regenerates, panda habitat may begin to recover after a period of at least 37 years.

Two alternate hypotheses describing urban landscape trajectories suggest urbanization is either leading to more homogeneous global patterns or urbanization has dichotomous trajectories of increasing dispersal or coalescence. To better understand the global variation in urban land-cover patterns and trajectories we described the variation in urban landscape structure for 120 cities distributed throughout the world assessed at circa 1990 and 2000. We coupled these data to a low-dimensional neighborhood based model of urban growth using a data-model fusion approach. Trajectories of urban growth were assessed using both the original data and model projections to 2030. The patterns of landscape change were related to both the rate of growth and income. The historical patterns of change showed a trend of increasing landscape complexity and this trend was projected to continue. Urban rate of growth was closely related to the change in several landscape metrics. Income was associated with landscape dynamics and this effect interacted with city size. Large cities were less sensitive to the income effect than small cities. Along with changes to the magnitude of each metric, the overall variation in metrics between years generally exhibited a decrease in variability and this variability was projected to continue decreasing.

Urban vegetation may provide a cooling ecosystem service, although many knowledge gaps exist in the biophysical and social dynamics of using this service to reduce climate extremes. To better understand patterns of urban vegetated cooling, the potential water requirements to supply these services, and differential access to these services between residential neighborhoods, we evaluated three decades (1970–2000) of land surface characteristics and residential segregation by income in the Phoenix, Arizona, USA metropolitan region. We developed an ecosystem service trade‐offs approach to assess the urban heat riskscape, defined as the spatial variation in risk exposure and potential human vulnerability to extreme heat. In this region, vegetation provided nearly a 25°C surface cooling compared to bare soil on low‐humidity summer days; the magnitude of this service was strongly coupled to air temperature and vapor pressure deficits. To estimate the water loss associated with land‐surface cooling, we applied a surface energy balance model. Our initial estimates suggest 2.7 mm/d of water may be used in supplying cooling ecosystem services in the Phoenix region on a summer day. The availability and corresponding resource use requirements of these ecosystem services had a strongly positive relationship with neighborhood income in the year 2000. However, economic stratification in access to services is a recent development: no vegetation–income relationship was observed in 1970, and a clear trend of increasing correlation was evident through 2000. To alleviate neighborhood inequality in risks from extreme heat through increased vegetation and evaporative cooling, large increases in regional water use would be required. Together, these results suggest the need for a systems evaluation of the benefits, costs, spatial structure, and temporal trajectory for the use of ecosystem services to moderate climate extremes. Increasing vegetation is one strategy for moderating regional climate changes in urban areas and simultaneously providing multiple ecosystem services. However, vegetation has economic, water, and social equity implications that vary dramatically across neighborhoods and need to be managed through informed environmental policies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior research shows that work in agriculture and construction/extraction occupations increases the risk of environmental heat-associated death.

Purpose
To assess the risk of environmental heat-associated death by occupation.

Methods
This was a case-control study. Cases were heat-caused and heat-related deaths occurring from May-October during the period 2002–2009 in Maricopa County, Arizona. Controls were selected at random from non-heat-associated deaths during the same period in Maricopa County. Information on occupation, age, sex, and race-ethnicity was obtained from death certificates. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios for heat-associated death.

Results
There were 444 cases of heat-associated deaths in adults (18+ years) and 925 adult controls. Of heat-associated deaths, 332 (75%) occurred in men; a construction/extraction or agriculture occupation was described on the death certificate in 115 (35%) of these men. In men, the age-adjusted odds ratios for heat-associated death were 2.32 (95% confidence interval 1.55, 3.48) in association with construction/extraction and 3.50 (95% confidence interval 1.94, 6.32) in association with agriculture occupations. The odds ratio for heat-associated death was 10.17 (95% confidence interval 5.38, 19.23) in men with unknown occupation. In women, the age-adjusted odds ratio for heat-associated death was 6.32 (95% confidence interval 1.48, 27.08) in association with unknown occupation. Men age 65 years and older in agriculture occupations were at especially high risk of heat-associated death.

Conclusion
The occurrence of environmental heat-associated death in men in agriculture and construction/extraction occupations in a setting with predictable periods of high summer temperatures presents opportunities for prevention.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thresholds were also identified for mortality from respiratory diseases in older people (ATmax = 109 °F; 42.8 °C) and for all-cause mortality in females (ATmax = 107 °F; 41.7 °C) and males <65 years (ATmax = 102 °F; 38.9 °C).

Comparison of measured near-surface air temperatures and wind speeds for 18 surface stations in the region show a good agreement between observed and simulated data for all simulation periods. The results indicate consistent significant contributions of urban development and accompanying LULC changes to extreme temperatures for the four EHEs. Simulations suggest new urban developments caused an intensification and expansion of the area experiencing extreme temperatures but mainly influenced nighttime temperatures with an increase of up to 10 K. Nighttime temperatures in the existing urban core showed changes of up to ∼2 K with the ongoing LULC changes. Daytime temperatures were not significantly affected where urban development replaced desert land (increase by ∼1 K); however, maximum temperatures increased by ∼2–4 K when irrigated agricultural land was converted to suburban development. According to the model simulations, urban landscaping irrigation contributed to cooling by 0.5–1 K in maximum daytime as well as minimum nighttime 2-m air temperatures in most parts of the urban region. Furthermore, urban development led to a reduction of the already relatively weak nighttime winds and therefore a reduction in advection of cooler air into the city.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that urbanization generally has a strong influence on vegetation compared to adjacent wildlands. In four of the metropolitan regions the cumulative enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and growing season length in low density developments were higher than grass, herb, and shrub land covers. Within all metropolitan regions, there was a significant socioeconomic effect where higher income areas had a higher cumulative EVI than lower income areas.

This study utilizes a socio-ecological research framework to investigate how public perceptions compared with environmental conditions in one urban center. Specifically, air temperature during an extreme heat event was examined as one characteristic of environmental conditions by relating simulations from the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) atmospheric model with self-reported perceptions of regional and neighborhood temperatures from a social survey of Phoenix, AZ (USA) metropolitan area residents. Results indicate that: 1) human exposure to high temperatures varies substantially throughout metropolitan Phoenix; 2) public perceptions of temperature are more strongly correlated with proximate environmental conditions than with distal conditions; and 3) perceptions of temperature are related to social characteristics and situational variables.

While appliance efficiency continues to increase, today’s homes are larger and residents are using more energy-consuming devices. Recent research has often described the energy–water nexus as a “tradeoff” between energy and water due to reduced temperatures resulting from irrigated vegetation. Accordingly, some arid cities have implemented landscape-conversion programs that encourage homeowners to convert their yards from grass (mesic) to drought-tolerant (xeric) landscapes to help conserve water resources. We investigated these relationships in Phoenix, Arizona by examining energy and water data for the summer months of June–September 2005 while temperature variability was analyzed from a local heat wave.

Restoring elements of the region’s historic fire-adapted prairie, savanna, and woodland habitats may help to reduce future wildfire risk and help conserve the region’s threatened biodiversity. We report on a mail survey (n = 939) examining the socio-demographic factors influencing private landowners’ likelihood of restoring fire-adapted habitats in the future. We found that newer landowners, landowners with a liberal political ideology, and landowners who have experienced wildfire are more likely to restore fire-adapted habitats in the future than their long-time owner, conservative, or inexperienced counterparts. However, experience with wildfire ceased to be a significant influence when we controlled for underlying landowner motivations for owning their property.

The framework accounts for uncertainty regarding: (1) the relationship between ecosystem vulnerability to losing ecological integrity and ecosystem resilience; (2) the relationship between ecosystem resilience and the extent to which observed indicators of ecological integrity depart from their thresholds; (3) the extent of future climate change; and (4) the potential impacts of future climate change on ecological integrity and ecosystem resilience.

The goal of this manuscript is to discuss key provisions of these emerging approaches to public safety during wildfire and evaluate their possible legacies. We do so by contrasting approaches in both countries with research insights on alternatives to evacuation during wildfire events. Insights are also paired with broader lessons from research on hazard, risk communication and wildfire. Our analysis provides insight on how emerging approaches could impact broader policy objectives for ‘creating fire-adapted communities’ and/or affect resident responsibility for personal wildfire protection.

We compare the performance of wildfire mitigation and fuel reduction actions across groups of residents with different primary evacuation preferences. We also explore what factors (e.g. actions, demographics, attitudes towards government, risk perceptions) help explain residents’ preferences for evacuation. Results suggest that relatively high proportions of residents are interested in staying and defending their homes, with smaller proportions favouring evacuation or passively sheltering in their homes during wildfire. Vegetation management behaviour differs significantly among residents with different evacuation preferences, including significantly higher rates of forest thinning among those intending to remain at home and actively defend their residence.

Four forest management objectives are used to demonstrate the framework, minimizing wildfire risk and water pollution and maximizing expected net return from timber sales and the extent of potential wildlife habitat. The fuzzy technique for preference by similarity to the ideal solution is used to rank the feasible spatial patterns for each subperiod in a planning horizon and alternative future. The resulting rankings for subperiods are used in a passive adaptive management procedure to determine if and when it is advantageous to adapt the spatial pattern over subperiods.

Wildfire risk, defined as expected residential losses from wildfire [E(RLW)], depends on the number of residential properties on parcels, the probability that parcels burn, the probability of wildfire losses to residential structures on properties given the parcels on which those properties are located burn, the average percentage of wildfire-related losses in aesthetic values of residential properties, and the total value (structures plus land) of residential properties. E(RLW) for the five subperiods is simulated for 2010 (referred to as the current), moderately restrictive, and highly restrictive land use policy scenarios, a moderate economic growth scenario and the A2 greenhouse gas emissions scenario. Results demonstrate that increasingly restrictive land use policy for Flathead County significantly reduces the amount and footprint of future residential development in the WUI. In addition, shifting from the current to a moderately restrictive land use policy for Flathead County significantly reduces wildfire risk for the WUI, but shifting from the current to a highly restrictive land use policy does not significantly reduce wildfire risk in the WUI.

Application of probability-based decision rules requires managers to specify certain probabilities, which is not possible when they are uncertain about the relationships between observed and true ecological conditions for a species. Under such uncertainty, the efficacy of CMAs can be evaluated and the best CMA selected using fuzzy decision rules.

The major objectives were to estimate aboveground live and dead terrestrial carbon stocks across multiple land cover classes and quantify the relationships between urban cover and vegetation across a gradient of urbanization. We established 154 sample plots in the Seattle region to assess carbon stocks as a function of distance from the urban core and land cover [urban (heavy, medium, and low), mixed forest, and conifer forest land covers]. The mean (and 95% CI) aboveground live biomass for the region was 89±22 Mg C ha−1 with an additional 11.8±4 Mg C ha−1 of coarse woody debris biomass.

Such procedures introduce errors where the proxy variables and actual emissions are weakly correlated, and limit analysis of the relationship between emissions and demographic trends at local scales. We develop an on-road emission inventory product for Massachusetts-based on roadway-level traffic data obtained from the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS).

Development altered aboveground and belowground C and N stocks, and the sign and magnitude of these changes varied by land use and development intensity. Aboveground biomass (live trees, dbh ≥ 5 cm) for the MSA was 7.2 ± 0.4 kg C/m2 (mean ± SE), reflecting a high proportion of forest cover. Vegetation C was highest in forest (11.6 ± 0.5 kg C/m2), followed by residential (4.6 ± 0.5 kg C/m2), and then other developed (2.0 ± 0.4 kg C/m2) land uses.

Within a land use type, urban areas (which we defined as >25% impervious surface area [ISA] within a 1‐km2 moving window) generally contained less vegetation C, but slightly more soil C, than nonurban areas. Soil N concentrations were higher in urban areas than nonurban areas of the same land use type, except for residential areas, which had similarly high soil N concentrations. When we compared our definition of urban to other commonly used urban extents (U.S. Census Bureau, Global Rural–Urban Mapping Project [GRUMP], and the MSA itself), we found that urban soil (1 m depth) and vegetation C stocks spanned a wide range, from 14.4 ± 0.8 to 54.5 ± 3.4 Tg C and from 4.2 ± 0.4 to 27.3 ± 3.2 Tg C, respectively.

At the field-plot scale, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was positively correlated with aboveground biomass (AGB) and foliar nitrogen (N) content and negatively correlated with impervious surface fraction. Unlike previous studies, we found no significant relationship between NDVI or impervious surface area (ISA) fraction and foliar N concentration. Patterns in foliar N appeared to be driven more strongly by changes in species composition rather than phenotypic plasticity across the urbanization gradient. For forest and non-residential development, soil nitrogen content increased with urban intensity. In contrast, residential land had consistently high soil N content across the gradient of urbanization. When field observations were scaled-up to the Boston Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), we found that soil and vegetation N content were negatively correlated with ISA fraction, an indicator of urban intensity. Our results demonstrated the importance of accounting for the influence of impervious surfaces when scaling field data across urban ecosystems. The combination of field data with remote sensing holds promise for disentangling the complex interactions that drive biogeochemical cycling in urbanizing landscapes.

Total anthropogenic emissions were estimated from an emissions inventory and ranged from 1.5 to 37.3 mg·C·ha−1·yr−1 between rural Harvard Forest and urban Boston. Despite this large increase in anthropogenic emissions, the mean annual difference in atmospheric CO2 between sites was approximately 5% (20.6 ± 0.4 ppm). The influence of vegetation was also visible across the gradient. Green-up occurred near day of year 126, 136, and 141 in Boston, Worcester and Harvard Forest, respectively, highlighting differences in growing season length. In Boston, gross primary production—estimated by scaling productivity by canopy cover—was ~75% lower than at Harvard Forest, yet still constituted a significant local flux of 3.8 mg·C·ha−1·yr−1. In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we must improve our understanding of the space-time variations and underlying drivers of urban carbon fluxes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",2,2,3,82,22Apr20,"Urban soils and vegetation contain large pools of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) and may sequester these elements at considerable rates; however, there have been no systematic studies of the composition of soils beneath the impervious surfaces that dominate urban areas. This has made it impossible to reliably estimate the net impact of urbanization on terrestrial C and N pools. In this study, we compared open area and impervious-covered soils in New York City and found that the C and N content of the soil (0–15 cm) under impervious surfaces was 66% and 95% lower, respectively. Analysis of extracellular enzyme activities in the soils suggests that recalcitrant compounds dominate the organic matter pool under impervious surfaces. If the differences between impervious-covered and open area soils represent a loss of C and N from urban ecosystems, the magnitude of these losses could offset sequestration in other parts of the urban landscape.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we applied a downscaling methodology based on commonly available spatial parameters to model on-road CO2 emissions at the 1 × 1 km scale for the Boston, MA region and tested our approach with surface-level CO2 observations. Using two previously constructed emissions inventories with differing spatial patterns and underlying data sources, we developed regression models based on impervious surface area and volume-weighted road density that could be scaled to any resolution. We found that the models accurately reflected the inventories at their original scales (R2 = 0.63 for both models) and exhibited a strong relationship with observed CO2 mixing ratios when downscaled across the region. Moreover, the improved spatial agreement of the models over the original inventories confirmed that either product represents a viable basis for downscaling in other metropolitan regions, even with limited data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we compiled the largest global dataset to date of two diverse taxa in cities: birds (54 cities) and plants (110 cities). We found that the majority of urban bird and plant species are native in the world's cities. Few plants and birds are cosmopolitan, the most common being Columba livia and Poa annua. The density of bird and plant species (the number of species per km2) has declined substantially: only 8% of native bird and 25% of native plant species are currently present compared with estimates of non-urban density of species. The current density of species in cities and the loss in density of species was best explained by anthropogenic features (landcover, city age) rather than by non-anthropogenic factors (geography, climate, topography). As urbanization continues to expand, efforts directed towards the conservation of intact vegetation within urban landscapes could support higher concentrations of both bird and plant species.

This dengue reemergence has provoked interest in the extent of the future threat posed by the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (L.), the primary vector of dengue and yellow fever viruses in urban settings, to human health in the continental United States. Ae. aegypti is an intriguing example of a vector species that not only occurs in the southernmost portions of the eastern United States today but also is incriminated as the likely primary vector in historical outbreaks of yellow fever as far north as New York, Philadelphia, and Boston, from the 1690s to the 1820s. For vector species with geographic ranges limited, in part, by low temperature and cool range margins occurring in the southern part of the continental United States, as is currently the case for Ae. aegypti, it is tempting to speculate that climate warming may result in a northward range expansion (similar to that seen for Ixodes tick vectors of Lyme borreliosis spirochetes in Scandinavia and southern Canada in recent decades). Although there is no doubt that climate conditions directly impact many aspects of the life history of Ae. aegypti, this mosquito also is closely linked to the human environment and directly influenced by the availability of water-holding containers for oviposition and larval development. Competition with other container-inhabiting mosquito species, particularly Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse), also may impact the presence and local abundance of Ae. aegypti. Field-based studies that focus solely on the impact of weather or climate factors on the presence and abundance of Ae. aegypti, including assessments of the potential impact of climate warming on the mosquito's future range and abundance, do not consider the potential confounding effects of socioeconomic factors or biological competitors for establishment and proliferation of Ae. aegypti. The results of such studies therefore should not be assumed to apply in areas with different socioeconomic conditions or composition of container-inhabiting mosquito species. For example, results from field-based studies at the high altitude cool margins for Ae. aegypti in Mexico's central highlands or the Andes in South America cannot be assumed to be directly applicable to geographic areas in the United States with comparable climate conditions. Unfortunately, we have a very poor understanding of how climatic drivers interact with the human landscape and biological competitors to impact establishment and proliferation of Ae. aegypti at the cool margin of its range in the continental United States. A first step toward assessing the future threat this mosquito poses to human health in the continental United States is to design and conduct studies across strategic climatic and socioeconomic gradients in the United States (including the U.S.–Mexico border area) to determine the permissiveness of the coupled natural and human environment for Ae. aegypti at the present time. This approach will require experimental studies and field surveys that focus specifically on climate conditions relevant to the continental United States. These studies also must include assessments of how the human landscape, particularly the impact of availability of larval developmental sites and the permissiveness of homes for mosquito intrusion, and the presence of other container-inhabiting mosquitoes that may compete with Ae. aegypti for larval habitat affects the ability of Ae. aegypti to establish and proliferate. Until we are armed with such knowledge, it is not possible to meaningfully assess the potential for climate warming to impact the proliferation potential for Ae. aegypti in the United States outside of the geographic areas where the mosquito already is firmly established, and even less so for dengue virus transmission and dengue disease in humans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess the elevation ceiling for Ae. aegypti and determine the potential for using weather/climate parameters to predict mosquito abundance, we surveyed 12 communities along an elevation/climate gradient from Veracruz City (sea level) to Puebla City (∼2,100 m). Ae. aegypti was commonly encountered up to 1,700 m and present but rare from 1,700 to 2,130 m. This finding extends the known elevation range in México by > 300 m.

There is substantial interest in how climate change may impact the bionomics and pathogen transmission potential of this mosquito. This Forum article focuses specifically on the effects of temperature on the bionomics of Ae. aegypti, with special emphasis on the cool geographic range margins where future rising temperatures could facilitate population growth. Key aims are to: 1) broadly define intra-annual (seasonal) patterns of occurrence and abundance of Ae. aegypti, and their relation to climate conditions; 2) synthesize the existing quantitative knowledge of how temperature impacts the bionomics of different life stages of Ae. aegypti; 3) better define the temperature ranges for which existing population dynamics models for Ae. aegypti are likely to produce robust predictions; 4) explore potential impacts of climate warming on human risk for exposure to Ae. aegypti at its cool range margins; and 5) identify knowledge or data gaps that hinder our ability to predict risk of human exposure to Ae. aegypti at the cool margins of its geographic range now and in the future. We first outline basic scenarios for intra-annual occurrence and abundance patterns for Ae. aegypti, and then show that these scenarios segregate with regard to climate conditions in selected cities where they occur. We then review how near-constant and intentionally fluctuating temperatures impact development times and survival of eggs and immatures. A subset of data, generated in controlled experimental studies, from the published literature is used to plot development rates and survival of eggs, larvae, and pupae in relation to water temperature. The general shape of the relationship between water temperature and development rate is similar for eggs, larvae, and pupae. Once the lower developmental zero temperature (10–14°C) is exceeded, there is a near-linear relationship up to 30°C. Above this temperature, the development rate is relatively stable or even decreases slightly before falling dramatically near the upper developmental zero temperature, which occurs at ∼38–42°C. Based on life stage-specific linear relationships between water temperature and development rate in the 15–28°C range, the lower developmental zero temperature is estimated to be 14.0°C for eggs, 11.8°C for larvae, and 10.3°C for pupae. We further conclude that available population dynamics models for Ae. aegypti, such as CIMSiM and Skeeter Buster, likely produce robust predictions based on water temperatures in the 16–35°C range, which includes the geographic areas where Ae. aegypti and its associated pathogens present the greatest threat to human health, but that they may be less reliable in cool range margins where water temperatures regularly fall below 15°C. Finally, we identify knowledge or data gaps that hinder our ability to predict risk of human exposure to Ae. aegypti at the cool margins of its range, now and in the future, based on impacts on mosquito population dynamics of temperature and other important factors, such as water nutrient content, larval density, presence of biological competitors, and human behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elevation was estimated through a digital elevation model (DEM). Strong correlations were found between mosquito abundance and RS-derived night LST, elevation and rainfall along the elevation/climate gradient.

An eddy detection and tracking method that can be used to capture eddy features from large datasets is presented. This method is applied to the 50 year model hindcast within a domain with the most energetic eddy activity along the GS. Detection results are then analyzed to investigate the kinematic properties and temporal variability of GS mesoscale eddies. The studied kinematic properties include the eddy size, duration, intensity, propagation, and spatial distribution. On average, cyclonic eddies are smaller in size but more energetic and remain coherent longer than anticyclonic ones. Cyclonic eddies generally travel further from the generation sites and have a strong tendency for westward propagation with a small equatorward deflection. Anticyclonic eddies remain near their generation locations and tend to propagate northward. The temporal evolution of eddy properties for long‐lived eddies (lifetime >90 days) is also examined. For both cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, the size increases rapidly to their maximum value within the first 20 days at which point they begin to slowly decay. In terms of intensity, cyclonic eddies show a quasi‐linear decay while the anticyclonic ones reach a quasi‐steady state after 3–4 months of a more rapid decay. Finally, the seasonal variability of the GS mesoscale eddies is explored. In autumn and winter, both types of eddies are more numerous and larger but less intense, while in spring they are more intense but less numerous and generally smaller. Several possible mechanisms, including the wind stress, thermal forcing, and topographic influence, are considered to explain the seasonal cycle of eddy variability.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Curchitser",Journal of Physical Oceanography,3,3,3,39,9Apr20,"A detailed energetics analysis of the Gulf Stream (GS) and associated eddies is performed using a high-resolution multidecadal regional ocean model simulation. The energy equations for the time-mean and time-varying flows are derived as a theoretical framework for the analysis. The eddy–mean flow energy components and their conversions show complex spatial distributions. In the along-coast region, the cross-stream and cross-bump variations are seen in the eddy–mean flow energy conversions, whereas in the off-coast region, a mixed positive–negative conversion pattern is observed. The local variations of the eddy–mean flow interaction are influenced by the varying bottom topography. When considering the domain-averaged energetics, the eddy–mean flow interaction shows significant along-stream variability. Upstream of Cape Hatteras, the energy is mainly transferred from the mean flow to the eddy field through barotropic and baroclinic instabilities. Upon separating from the coast, the GS becomes highly unstable and both energy conversions intensify. When the GS flows into the off-coast region, an inverse conversion from the eddy field to the mean flow dominates the power transfer. For the entire GS region, the mean current is intrinsically unstable and transfers 28.26 GW of kinetic energy and 26.80 GW of available potential energy to the eddy field. The mesoscale eddy kinetic energy is generated by mixed barotropic and baroclinic instabilities, contributing 28.26 and 9.15 GW, respectively. Beyond directly supplying the barotropic pathway, mean kinetic energy also provides 11.55 GW of power to mean available potential energy and subsequently facilitates the baroclinic instability pathway.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditional computational models have portrayed sharing knowledge through interactions among members of social groups via dyadic networks. Such models aim at understanding the percolation of information among individuals and groups to identify potential limitations to successful knowledge transfer. However, because many real-world interactions are not solely pairwise, i.e., several group members may obtain information from one another simultaneously, it is necessary to understand more than dyadic communication and learning processes to capture their full complexity. We detail a modeling framework based on the simplicial set, a concept from algebraic topology, which allows elegant encapsulation of multi-agent interactions. Such a model system allows us to analyze how individual information within groups accumulates as the group’s collective set of knowledge, which may be different than the simple union of individually contained information. Furthermore, the simplicial modeling approach we propose allows us to investigate how information accumulates via sub-group interactions, offering insight into complex aspects of multi-way communication systems. The fundamental change in modeling strategy we offer here allows us to move from portraying knowledge as a “token”, passed from signaler to receiver, to portraying knowledge as a set of accumulating building blocks from which novel ideas can emerge.

After damage, each node decides independently whether to create a new link depending on the fraction of neighbors it has lost. In addition to relying only on local information, where nodes do not need knowledge of the global network status, we impose the additional constraint that new links should be as short as possible (i.e. that the new edge completes a shortest possible new cycle).

A set of three numerical experiments with different surface wind and buoyancy forcing is analyzed to investigate the mechanisms governing the seasonal cycle of upper ocean energetics. In the GS along-coast region, MKE has a significant seasonal cycle that peaks in summer, while EKE has two comparable peaks in May and September near the surface; the May peak decays rapidly with depth. In the off-coast region, MKE has a weak seasonal cycle that peaks in summer, while EKE has a dominant peak in May and a secondary peak in September near the surface. The May peak also decays with depth leaving the September peak as the only seasonal signal below 100 m. An analysis of the three numerical experiments suggests that the seasonal variability in the local wind forcing significantly impacts the September peak of the along-coast EKE through a local-flow barotropic instability process. Alternatively, the seasonal buoyancy forcing primarily impacts the flow baroclinic instability and is consequently related to the May peak of the upper ocean EKE in both regions. The analysis results indicate that the seasonal cycle of the along-coast MKE is influenced by both local energy generation by wind and the advection of energy from upstream regions. Finally, the MKE cycle and the September peak of EKE in the off-coast region are mainly affected by advection of energy from remote regions, giving rise to correlations with the seasonal cycle of remote winds.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Electric power generation expansion planning (GEP) problems that determine the optimal expansion capacity and technology under particular technical constraints, given cost and policy assumptions, are undoubtedly among those decisions. The best approach to comprehensively model climate change uncertainties, and to optimize the generation planning under uncertainty needs to be rigorously studied. In this research, a preliminary GEP model is proposed with available input data from various sources. Discrete scenarios of possible climate change outcomes are defined and optimization models are formulated to specifically model uncertainty. Relationships between climate change and GEP parameters are defined for each scenario to consider their effects. The preliminary GEP model is then solved under each scenario to identify the climate change impact on generation expansion planning decisions.

The fishery is almost completely based on lobsters just molting to legal size each year and thus is vulnerable to changes in environmental or ecological conditions that reduce recruitment. I use a bioeconomic model of the fishery that incorporates an empirically estimated vessel-level production function to evaluate how a reduction in recruitment might affect profitability and optimal effort levels relative to recent years. While large reductions in effort would almost certainly be required to maintain fishery profitability, the degree of effort reduction and the optimal seasonal distribution of effort and catch are sensitive to the time series of data used to estimate the production function. Because of the unidirectional upward trend in recruitment and catches, it is unclear whether changes in the production function are due to technological innovation or ecological change. However, the answer has important implications for the level of effort the fishery may be able to profitably support in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the predator-prey modeling literature has shown, such linkages can substantially alter the outcomes of management strategies from those predicted by models naïve to these linkages. In this article, we explore the implications of a linkage between fisheries due to an artificial predator-prey relationship; the use of one harvested species as an input to the harvest technology in another primary fishery whose biological productivity is also positively affected by bait consumption. These anthropogenic, technological, and biological linkages between the fisheries alter both the open-access and rent-maximizing equilibria of the primary fishery. Furthermore, shifts in economic, technological, or biological parameters of either fishery can have significantly different impacts on the bioeconomic equilibria than those predicted by a traditional single-species model.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it may be difficult and costly to assess and manage stocks at a finer spatial scale, and there is generally greater uncertainty about the size of substocks than about the aggregate stock. We use a two-patch, age-structured metapopulation model to compare the performance of global vs. area-specific total allowable catch constraints (TACs). The relative performance of these approaches, in terms of profits and risk of depleting subpopulations, depends upon biological, technical and economic parameters — in particular various kinds of uncertainty, aggregation of fish stocks, and the spatial dynamics of different age classes. Surprisingly, a global TAC is less risky when there is little mixing of the subpopulations, as long as target mortality rates are not set too high. The advantage of the global TAC is reduced when there is mixing and migration between the subpopulations, particularly when these dynamics are asymmetric. However, a regulator naïve to the nature of the true spatial dynamics (and hence the spatially optimal target fishing mortality rates) may still be better off employing a global TAC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of discrete subpopulations within managed fish stocks presents risks and opportunities for fishery management. Failure to manage catch at the same scale as the true population structure can lead to extirpation of discrete subpopulations and to declines in the productivity of the larger metapopulation. However, it may be difficult and costly to assess and manage stocks at a finer spatial scale, and there is likely greater uncertainty about the size of substocks than about the aggregate stock. We use a two‐area simulation model to compare the performance of fishery management at different spatial resolutions when there is uncertainty about growth, the size of the total population, and the relative size of the subpopulations. We show that relative benefits of finer scale management, in terms of profits and risks of depleting subpopulations, depend on a number of biological, technical, and economic factors. In some cases it may be both less risky and more profitable to manage the fishery with a single total allowable catch, even when there are biologically separate fish populations in the two areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A considerable amount of data on various life stages of lobsters has been collected for research, management and conservation purposes over the past 15 years. We have used these data sets to develop models that simulate lobster populations from newly hatched larval stage through settlement and recruitment to the fishery. This paper presents a part of the synthesis study that focuses on the early life history of lobsters. A coupled biophysical individual based model was developed that considers patterns of egg production (abundance, distribution and timing of hatch), temperature-dependent larval growth, stage-explicit vertical distributions of larvae, and mortality. The biophysical model was embedded in the realistic simulations of the physical environment (current and temperature) from the Gulf of Maine Nowcast/Forecast System. The predominant direction of larval movement follows the cyclonic Gulf of Maine Coastal Current (GMCC). Results show relatively low accumulation of planktonic stages along the eastern Maine coast and high accumulation along the western Maine coast. In years when the eastern branch of the GMCC turns offshore southeast of Penobscot Bay, more particles accumulate downstream of the branch point. Interannual variability is also apparent in development times that vary as a function of year-to-year water temperature variation. The larval stages tend to remain relatively near shore, but the final planktonic stage (the postlarva) resides near the sea surface, and the prevailing southwesterly winds in summer cause eastward and offshore drift of postlarvae. Thus, more settlement might take place earlier in the potentially long postlarval stage, and the timing and strength of the southwesterly winds are important in determining the population of potential settlers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It synthesizes current data on species diversity of zooplankton and pelagic nekton, including compilation of observed species and descriptions of seasonal, regional and cross-shelf diversity patterns. Zooplankton diversity in the GoMA is characterized by spatial differences in community composition among the neritic environment, the coastal shelf, and deep offshore waters. Copepod diversity increased with depth on the Scotian Shelf. On the coastal shelf of the western Gulf of Maine, the number of higher-level taxonomic groups declined with distance from shore, reflecting more nearshore meroplankton. Copepod diversity increased in late summer, and interdecadal diversity shifts were observed, including a period of higher diversity in the 1990s. Changes in species diversity were greatest on interannual scales, intermediate on seasonal scales, and smallest across regions, in contrast to abundance patterns, suggesting that zooplankton diversity may be a more sensitive indicator of ecosystem response to interannual climate variation than zooplankton abundance. Local factors such as bathymetry, proximity of the coast, and advection probably drive zooplankton and pelagic nekton diversity patterns in the GoMA, while ocean-basin-scale diversity patterns probably contribute to the increase in diversity at the Scotian Shelf break, a zone of mixing between the cold-temperate community of the shelf and the warm-water community offshore. Pressing research needs include establishment of a comprehensive system for observing change in zooplankton and pelagic nekton diversity, enhanced observations of “underknown” but important functional components of the ecosystem, population and metapopulation studies, and development of analytical modeling tools to enhance understanding of diversity patterns and drivers. Ultimately, sustained observations and modeling analysis of biodiversity must be effectively communicated to managers and incorporated into ecosystem approaches for management of GoMA living marine resources.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",Journal of Ecology,2,3,3,85,9Apr20,"1. Residential development is often concentrated near aquatic ecosystems and understanding riparian–littoral zone interactions is therefore critical for assessing its ecological effects.
2. Introduction of wood from riparian forests into the littoral zone, where it becomes habitat for aquatic organisms, is an important, but poorly understood, process. We related the density of littoral coarse wood both among and within 45 lakes in Vilas County, Wisconsin, USA, to forest structure, abiotic drivers and land use.
3. Among all lakes and among a subset of low‐development lakes, the best predictor of the density of littoral coarse wood was the density of riparian coarse wood. At the within‐lake (site) level, two alternative models explain variability in coarse wood abundance: as a function of exposure to wind and amount of riparian coarse wood or as a function of exposure to wind and land‐use intensity.
4. Both among and within lakes, areas more modified by humans had a lower density of littoral coarse wood. Conversely, areas with little (current) human impact were tremendously variable; some sites and lakes had abundant wood and others had virtually none.
5. Contrary to previous studies, there was no relationship between living trees and coarse wood density, suggesting that riparian and littoral coarse wood densities may be strongly influenced by past disturbance, both human and natural.
6. This study highlights the importance of cross boundary subsidies in understanding the impact of development on ecosystems. The concentration of residential development at the boundary between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems appears to reduce the flow of coarse wood from forests to lakes.

They also tend to assume that the manager is outside the system being managed. However, where the objectives include long-term sustainability, linked social-ecological systems (SESs) behave as complex adaptive systems, with the managers as integral components of the system. Moreover, uncertainties are large and it may be difficult to reduce them as fast as the system changes. Sustainability involves maintaining the functionality of a system when it is perturbed, or maintaining the elements needed to renew or reorganize if a large perturbation radically alters structure and function. The ability to do this is termed “resilience.” This paper presents an evolving approach to analyzing resilience in SESs, as a basis for managing resilience. We propose a framework with four steps, involving close involvement of SES stakeholders. It begins with a stakeholder-led development of a conceptual model of the system, including its historical profile (how it got to be what it is) and preliminary assessments of the drivers of the supply of key ecosystem goods and services. Step 2 deals with identifying the range of unpredictable and uncontrollable drivers, stakeholder visions for the future, and contrasting possible future policies, weaving these three factors into a limited set of future scenarios. Step 3 uses the outputs from steps 1 and 2 to explore the SES for resilience in an iterative way. It generally includes the development of simple models of the system’s dynamics for exploring attributes that affect resilience. Step 4 is a stakeholder evaluation of the process and outcomes in terms of policy and management implications.

When the world is highly unpredictable and we are working from a limited range of expectations, however, our expectations will frequently be proved wrong. Scenario planning offers a framework for developing more resilient conservation policies when faced with uncontrollable, irreducible uncertainty. A scenario in this context is an account of a plausible future. Scenario planning consists of using a few contrasting scenarios to explore the uncertainty surrounding the future consequences of a decision. Ideally, scenarios should be constructed by a diverse group of people for a single, stated purpose. Scenario planning can incorporate a variety of quantitative and qualitative information in the decision‐making process. Often, consideration of this diverse information in a systemic way leads to better decisions. Furthermore, the participation of a diverse group of people in a systemic process of collecting, discussing, and analyzing scenarios builds shared understanding. The robustness provided by the consideration of multiple possible futures has served several groups well; we present examples from business, government, and conservation planning that illustrate the value of scenario planning. For conservation, major benefits of using scenario planning are ( 1 ) increased understanding of key uncertainties, ( 2 ) incorporation of alternative perspectives into conservation planning, and ( 3 ) greater resilience of decisions to surprise.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",Trends in Ecology and Evolution ,3,2,2,2353,9Apr20,"Occasionally, surprisingly large shifts occur in ecosystems. Theory suggests that such shifts can be attributed to alternative stable states. Verifying this diagnosis is important because it implies a radically different view on management options, and on the potential effects of global change on such ecosystems. For instance, it implies that gradual changes in temperature or other factors might have little effect until a threshold is reached at which a large shift occurs that might be difficult to reverse. Strategies to assess whether alternative stable states are present are now converging in fields as disparate as desertification, limnology, oceanography and climatology.

",Nature,3,3,3,179,9Apr20,"One of the few generalities in ecology, Taylor's power law1,2,3, describes the species-specific relationship between the temporal or spatial variance of populations and their mean abundances. For populations experiencing constant per capita environmental variability, the regression of log variance versus log mean abundance gives a line with a slope of 2. Despite this expectation, most species have slopes of less than 2 (refs 2, 3–4), indicating that more abundant populations of a species are relatively less variable than expected on the basis of simple statistical grounds. What causes abundant populations to be less variable has received considerable attention5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12, but an explanation for the generality of this pattern is still lacking. Here we suggest a novel explanation for the scaling of temporal variability in population abundances. Using stochastic simulation and analytical models, we demonstrate how negative interactions among species in a community can produce slopes of Taylor's power law of less than 2, like those observed in real data sets.

We designed a field study to determine if selective pr?dation by fishes accounts for population dominance of the exotic rusty crayfish, Orconectes rusticus, in a northern Wisconsin lake. We hypothesized that fish predators avoid consuming O. rusticus in favor of congeners O. propinquus and O. virilis because O. rusticus attains either superior size or is more aggressive than its congeners. Largely based on previous experimental work, we expected that predators would consume smaller individuals of rusty crayfish than of other species, as a result of behavioral differences among crayfish species. Although smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) consumed fewer rusty crayfish than expected based on relative prey abundance, predators consumed similar sized crayfish of all species. Further, our results indicated that predators likely avoid O. rusticus because they have larger chelae than congeners, and that behavioral differences did not appear to contribute substantially to crayfish selection at the whole lake scale. Our results suggest that selective pr?dation based on chelae size is one of the primary drivers of this species replacement.

",Ecology and Society,1,1,1,243,9Apr20,"The dynamics of and policies governing spatially coupled social-ecological mosaics are considered for the case of fisheries in a lake district. A microeconomic model of households addresses agent decisions at three hierarchic levels: (1) selection of the lake district from among a larger set of alternative places to live or visit, (2) selection of a base location within the lake district, and (3) selection of a portfolio of ecosystem services to use. Ecosystem services are represented by dynamics of fish production subject to multiple stable domains and trophic cascades. Policy calculations show that optimal policies will be highly heterogeneous in space and fluid in time. The diversity of possible outcomes is illustrated by simulations for a hypothetical lake district based loosely on the Northern Highlands of the State of Wisconsin. Lake districts are frequently managed as if lakes were independent, similar, endogenously regulating systems. Our findings contradict that view. One-size-fits-all (OSFA) policies erode ecological and social resilience. If regulations are too stringent, social resilience declines because of the potential rewards of overharvesting. If regulations are too lax, ecological resilience is diminished by overharvesting in some lakes. In either case, local collapses of fish populations evoke spatial shifts of angling effort that can lead to serial collapses in neighboring fisheries and degraded fisheries in most or all of the lakes. Under OSFA management, the natural resources of the entire landscape become more vulnerable to transformation because of changes in, e.g., human population, the demand for resources, or fish harvesting technology. Multiplicity of management regimes can increase the ecological resilience, social resilience, and inclusive value of a spatially heterogeneous social-ecological system. Because of the complex interactions of mobile people and multistable ecosystems, management regimes must also be flexible over time. A rights-based scheme may facilitate policy regimes with appropriate spatial patterns and intertemporal fluidity. In lake fisheries, habitat protection adds an important dimension to policy design.

Managers consider two management models of the lake, one for an oligotrophic lake and the other for a eutrophic lake. As managers observe the lake varying from year to year, they estimate how well each of the two management models is supported by the observed data. Management policies maximize the expected net present value of the lake.

In one episode concerning a retired actress who falls victim to a confidence trick, Sergeant Friday sweeps aside the irrelevant circumstantial details offered by the actress and solves the puzzle with characteristic ease. Friday's sidekick, Bill Gannon, responds to a different challenge and touchingly asks for the faded actress's autograph. “I didn't know you collected autographs,” says Joe, as they leave the scene. “I don't,” replies Bill. Dragnet is a modern version of a morality play, myths and all, the prevailing myth being that it may take time to apprehend the suspect, but eventually “just the facts” will inexorably solve the crime. But isn't Bill Gannon essential to this process? Many scientists share Joe Friday's mythic goal. In the simple world of Sergeant Friday, there is a single true answer; in the scientific equivalent, the scientist believes that there is a single truth, and attempts to find it. Much scientific activity uses simple models, and thus amounts to no more than calibration. But as our colleague John Norman in the Department of Soil Science at the University of Wisconsin points out, “I can do a lot with those calibrations” (and he can, too), so we must not underestimate the importance of focusing situations until they become simple. Successfully casting a system as simple results in consistent and singular answers as well as reliable predictions. However, from that consistency it does not follow that the singularity of answers arises from their being expressions of singular truths. It could easily be that the consistency results from the constraints we scientists impose on the system in order to make it simple. Furthermore, the scientist has no way to distinguish between singular truth and constraint when the data are applied to a simple model, no matter how meticulous the collection of those data. Much as Dragnet has a mythic quality, so does science that seeks out the single quantified truth. Such science would remain mythic, even in the extremely unlikely event that the simple model could indeed reflect the reality fully, for the argument about truth turns not directly on data per se, but on the belief that the perception of data yields truth.

Understanding how nutrients are transformed and retained within

Indiana and Michigan to develop a more comprehensive understanding of 
the factors controlling nutrient retention and export in agricultural 
streams using nutrient addition and isotopic tracer studies.
            3. Metrics of nutrient uptake indicated that nitrate 
uptake was saturated in these streams whereas ammonium and phosphorus 
uptake increased with higher concentrations. Phosphorus uptake was 
likely approaching saturation as evidenced by decreasing uptake 
velocities with concentration; ammonium uptake velocity also declined 
with concentration, though not significantly.
            4. Higher whole‐stream uptake rates of phosphorus and 
ammonium were associated with the observed presence of stream autotrophs

relationship between measures of nutrient uptake and stream metabolism. 
Water‐column nutrient concentrations were positively correlated with 
gross primary production but not community respiration.

Biological uptake of ammonium and phosphorus was not saturated, although
 nitrate uptake did appear to be saturated in these ecosystems. 
Biological activity in agriculturally influenced streams is higher

We used a 4400‐ha reservoir to determine the role of denitrification in the N mass balance and effectiveness in reducing downstream transport of NO3‐N. Sediment denitrification was (1) measured monthly (March 2002–March 2003) at eight sites in the Lake Shelbyville reservoir in central Illinois using the acetylene inhibition, chloramphenicol technique, (2) scaled to the overall reservoir and compared to N not accounted for in a mass balance, and (3) estimated indirectly using long‐term (1981–2003) mass balances of N in the reservoir. Denitrification rates in the reservoir were high during spring and early summer of 2002, when maximum NO3‐N concentrations were measured (10–14 mg NO3‐N/L). We estimated that denitrification for the year was between 2580 and 5150 Mg N. Missing N from the mass balance was 3004 Mg N, suggesting that sediment denitrification was the sink. Areal rates of sediment denitrification in the reservoir ranged from 62 to 225 g N·m−2·yr−1, with rates a function of both denitrification intensity (μg N·g dry mass·h−1) and the overall mass of sediment present. From 1981 to 2003 the average NO3‐N inlet flux was 8900 Mg N/yr. About 58% of the total NO3‐N input was removed, and annual NO3‐N removed as a percentage of inputs was significantly related to reservoir retention time (average = 0.36 yr for the 23 years, range = 0.21–0.84 yr). By scaling denitrification in Lake Shelbyville to other reservoirs in Illinois, we estimated a sink of 48 900 Mg N/yr. When combined with estimated in‐stream denitrification, 60 900 Mg N/yr was estimated to be removed by sediment denitrification.

Measuring NH4+ concentrations requires accounting for matrix effects (ME) that are caused by substances in the sample that attenuate or intensify the signal of the samples relative to the standards. We show that the ME calculation in the recently published fluorometric NH4+ method is mathematically incorrect, producing results that consistently underestimate NH4+ concentration as a nonlinear function of the ME. We provide the correct equation and offer an alternative approach that accounts for ME by using sample water rather than deionized water to make the standards, thereby producing a standard curve that contains the same background chemical properties as the samples. In addition, we show that the previous method for measuring a sample’s background fluorescence does not include the background signal of the reagent or its interaction with the matrix constituents of the sample. We provide a new method for measuring a sample’s background fluorescence that includes the background fluorescence of the sample, reagent, and their interaction.

",Biogeochemistry,3,3,3,105,15Apr20,"Reservoirs are intrinsically linked to the rivers that feed them, creating a river–reservoir continuum in which water and sediment inputs are a function of the surrounding watershed land use. We examined the spatial and temporal variability of sediment denitrification rates by sampling longitudinally along an agriculturally influenced river–reservoir continuum monthly for 13 months. Sediment denitrification rates ranged from 0 to 63 μg N2O g ash free dry mass of sediments (AFDM)−1 h−1 or 0–2.7 μg N2O g dry mass of sediments (DM)−1 h−1 at reservoir sites, vs. 0–12 μg N2O gAFDM−1 h−1 or 0–0.27 μg N2O gDM−1 h−1 at riverine sites. Temporally, highest denitrification activity traveled through the reservoir from upper reservoir sites to the dam, following the load of high nitrate (NO −3 -N) water associated with spring runoff. Annual mean sediment denitrification rates at different reservoir sites were consistently higher than at riverine sites, yet significant relationships among theses sites differed when denitrification rates were expressed per gDM vs. per gAFDM. There was a significant positive relationship between sediment denitrification rates and NO −3 -N concentration up to a threshold of 0.88 mg NO −3  -N l−1, above which it appeared NO −3 -N was no longer limiting. Denitrification assays were amended seasonally with NO −3 -N and an organic carbon source (glucose) to determine nutrient limitation of sediment denitrification. While organic carbon never limited sediment denitrification, all sites were significantly limited by NO −3 -N during fall and winter when ambient NO −3 -N was low.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",Limnology and Oceanography - Methods,3,3,3,51,15Apr20,"Stable isotope addition experiments seeking to trace the denitrification of combined forms of nitrogen (N) to gaseous N2 in aquatic environments typically need to measure the stable isotope ratio of dissolved nitrogen gas. This measurement presents challenges because of the potential for contamination of samples by N in air, and because field experiments conducted in situ often do not produce a marked enrichment in the isotope ratio of the N2 pool. Field experiments also require numerous samples, sometimes processed under arduous conditions, and thus methods have to be convenient and low in cost. This paper describes the methods for sampling and measurement of the N isotope ratio of dissolved nitrogen that were developed for the isotope addition experiments in the Lotic Intersite Nitrogen Experiment (LINX), a cross‐site study examining N biogeochemistry in headwater streams. Headspace equilibration was performed in the field and gas samples were stored in re‐evacuated glass vials (Exetainers). Samples were processed and stored underwater to minimize the potential for contamination of samples by air. Isotope ratios were measured using a gas chromatograph interfaced to the isotope ratio mass spectrometer and equipped with a custom sample entry system.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study examined data from a stable isotope addition experiment in which 15N-labeled NH4+ was added to a midwestern US stream. A compartment model was used to provide insights into the kinetics of 15N uptake and release from algae, heterotrophic microbes colonizing detritus, and invertebrate consumers. The model accounted for temporal variation in the degree of isotopic enrichment and did not require the assumption of isotopic equilibrium between consumers and their diets. The importance of instream production (i.e., growth of algae and microbes within the study reach during the experiment) relative to allochthonous and upstream inputs was ∼38 to 50% for heptageniids and Psephenus, 10 to 20% for Orconectes propinquus, Gammarus, hydropsychids, and larval Stenelmis, and <10% for the filter-feeding Similium and the unionid mussel Pleurobema sintoxia. The alternative choices of algae or heterotrophic microbes as the basis of consumer diets made little difference in these estimates, even though the microbes became more 15N-enriched than the algae because microbes had higher turnover rates. These results were subject to a number of caveats, and guidelines for experimental design are suggested for future studies to help address some of these problems.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sediment denitrification rates were determined using the chloramphenicol-amended acetylene inhibition technique. Agricultural streams had high concentrations of NO3−-N, DOC, soluble reactive P, and NH4+-N, whereas forested streams had the lowest concentrations of these nutrients, and urban streams generally exhibited intermediate concentrations. Sediment denitrification rates were highest in agricultural streams and lowest in forested streams throughout the study period. Availability of NO3−-N was the dominant environmental predictor of sediment denitrification rates, limiting denitrification when NO3−-N concentrations were below a calculated threshold of 0.4 mg NO3−-N/L. Other potential controlling variables (e.g., DOC, dissolved O2, water temperature, and sediment organic matter content) influenced denitrification rates secondarily.

High nitrate loading degrades water quality and is linked to eutrophication and harmful algal blooms, especially in coastal marine waters. Past research on nitrate removal processes has emphasized plant or microbial uptake (assimilation) or respiratory denitrification by bacteria. The increasing application of stable isotopes and other tracer techniques to the study of nitrate removal has yielded a growing body of evidence for alternative, microbially mediated processes of nitrate transformation. These include dissimilatory (the reduction of nitrogen into other inorganic compounds, coupled to energy producing processes) reduction of nitrate to ammonium (DNRA), chemoautotrophic denitrification via sulfur or iron oxidation, and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), as well as abiotic nitrate removal processes. Here, we review evidence for the importance of alternative nitrate removal pathways in aquatic ecosystems and discuss how the possible prevalence of these pathways may alter views of N cycling and its controls. These alternative pathways are of particular importance for the management of excess N in the environment, especially in cases where nitrate is transformed to ammonium, a biologically available and less mobile N form, rather than to dinitrogen gas.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The field experiment consisted of an 8‐h addition of 99 atom% K15NO3 and a conservative solute tracer. Two 15N tracer addition experiments were performed on consecutive days, the first under ambient NO3− concentrations (23 µg N L−1) and the second with a NO3− addition of approximately 500 µg N L−1. We fit first‐order NO3− uptake and two‐box denitrification models to the longitudinal measurements of tracer 15N in dissolved NO3−, N2, and N2O in stream water to determine rates. Total NO3− uptake rates were 0.028 m−1 (0.32 µg N m−2 s−1) and 0.01 m−1 (1.6 µg N m−2 s−1) under ambient NO3− and with NO3− addition, respectively.

The Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) built the road the fast track way: “Design and build.” The project disrupted traffic for four and a half years. Had the freeway been rebuilt by several traditional “design-bid-build” contracts, traffic would have been disrupted for about a decade. This paper compares the disruptive impacts of fast track and traditional construction. Traffic delays, accidents, and emissions estimates for each approach provide a highly detailed assessment of the implications of building quickly. The road closure schedules for each alternative are based on recorded events and UDOT standard practice. The travel modeling is done through VISUM with diurnal traffic assignments. The results show that fast track construction is superior to the traditional approach in terms of user delays. While the impact of emissions and accidents is measurable, it proves to be less significant. The paper reaches the conclusion that the fast track approach to I-15 reconstruction was the right decision because it produced less disruption for travelers than the traditional method.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Integrated land use and transportation models that simulate energy use and traffic‐related emissions are already in place in many North American cities. To these can be added a growing dataset of carbon gains and losses in vegetation and soils following urbanization, and a number of methods of validating urban carbon balance modeling, including top down atmospheric monitoring and urban ‘metabolic’ studies of whole ecosystem mass and energy flow. Here, we review the state of our understanding of urban areas as whole ecosystems with regard to carbon balance, including both drivers of fossil fuel emissions and carbon cycling in urban plants and soils.

We measured CO2 mixing ratios and the isotopic composition of CO2 at four locations in the Salt Lake Valley, Utah, during a persistent cold pool event in the winter of 2004. The results showed a strong influence of atmospheric stability and the height of the capping inversion on CO2 mixing ratios and suggested that during persistent cold pool events the air mass beneath the capping inversion can be relatively well mixed. Spatial and temporal patterns in the isotopic composition of CO2 and the relationship between particulate concentrations and CO2 mixing ratio support this interpretation. These results suggest that CO2 mixing ratio, which is abundant and relatively easily measured in urban atmospheres, can provide information about complex wintertime atmospheric transport and mixing as well as carbon cycling in urban mountain basins.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In C budget studies, the isotopic composition of crude petroleum and CH4 are often used as a proxy for the isotopic composition of CO2 emissions from combustion. In this study, the C isotope composition (δ13C) of exhaust from the major fossil fuel emission sources in Salt Lake City, USA, was characterized with 159 measurements of vehicle exhaust of various types and eight measurements of residential furnace exhaust. These two sources were found to be isotopically distinct, and differed from global-scale estimates based on average values for crude petroleum and CH4. Vehicle-specific factors such as engine load and operation time had no effect on δ13C of vehicle exhaust. A small difference was found between the mean δ13C of vehicle exhaust collected randomly from different vehicles and the mean δ13C of gasoline collected from multiple fueling stations representing major gasoline distributors in Salt Lake City and the surrounding area. However, a paired comparison of δ13C of exhaust and gasoline for six different vehicles did not show any consistent C isotope fractionation during vehicle combustion. The mean δ13C of crude petroleum processed for local distribution differed slightly from refined gasoline collected at multiple fueling stations, but time lags between processing and transportation cannot be ruled out as an uncontrollable contributing factor. Measured isotope ratios were then combined with fuel consumption statistics to predict the annual cycle of δ13C of fossil fuel emissions for the Salt Lake City metropolitan area. The results showed that the isotopic composition of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion varied by almost 3‰ over the course of the 2002 calendar year. This study illustrates that on a regional scale, the isotopic composition of fossil fuel emissions shows a high degree of both spatial and temporal variability that may influence characterization of C sources and sinks with atmospheric measurements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results also suggested differences in the role of leaf versus soil respiration between the two urban sites, with seasonal variation in the contribution of leaf respiration at a residential site and relatively constant contributions of leaf respiration at the city center.

Anthropogenic interventions led to the depletion of 76%, 86% and 67% of the total SOC; and 77%, 85% and 66% of the N concentrations from the surface soils of Nandi, Kakamega and the South African sites, respectively, over a period of up to 100 years. Significant proportions of the total SOC (46–73%) and N (37–73%) losses occurred during the first 4 years of conversion indicating that these forest‐ and grassland‐derived soils contain large amounts of labile soil organic matter (SOM), potentially vulnerable to degradation upon human‐induced land‐use and land‐cover changes. Anthropogenic perturbations altered not only the C sink capacity of these soils, but also the functional group composition and dynamics of SOC with time, rendering structural composition of the resultant organic matter in the agricultural soils to be considerably different from the SOM under natural forest and grassland ecosystems. These molecular level compositional changes were manifested: (i) by the continued degradation of O‐alkyl and acetal‐C structures found in carbohydrate and holocellulose biomolecules, some labile aliphatic‐C functionalities, (ii) by side‐chain oxidation of phenylpropane units of lignin and (iii) by the continued aromatization and aliphatization of the humic fractions possibly through selective accumulation of recalcitrant H and C substituted aryl‐C and aliphatic‐C components such as (poly)‐methylene units, respectively. These changes appeared as early as the fourth year after transition, and their intensity increased with duration of cultivation until a new quasi‐equilibrium of SOC was approached at about 20 years after conversion. However, subtle but persistent changes in molecular structures of the resultant SOM continued long after (up to 100 years) a steady state for SOC was approached. These molecular level changes in the inherent structural composition of SOC may exert considerable influence on biogeochemical cycling of C and bioavailability of essential nutrients present in association with SOM, and may significantly affect the sustainability of agriculture as well as potentials of the soils to sequester C in these tropical and subtropical highland agroecosystems",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 or without appreciable amounts of tannins and alkaloids was studied in vitro. The legumes studied included Calliandra calothyrsus Meissner, Acacia angustissima Kuntze, Desmodium uncinatum DC, Desmodium intortum DC (all containing tannins), Crotalaria ochroleuca Gidon and Lupinus albus L. (containing alkaloids). The plants with low levels of tannins and alkaloids were Neonotonia wightii Lackey and Lablab purpureus
 L. cv. Rongai (Sweet). Both unfractionated legumes and their isolated 
neutral detergent fiber (xNDF) were studied. In addition, polyethylene 
glycol (PEG, MW 4000) was added to the fermentations of 
tannin-containing forages and their isolated NDF. Unfractionated legumes
 varied widely in NDF digestibility. The NDF digestibility of intact C. calothyrsus, A. angustissima, C. ochroleuca and D. intortum was less than 40% and lower than that of the other legumes. C.alothyrsus and C. ochroleuca
 had the greatest increase (P<0.05) in NDF digestibility following 
extraction with ND solution when compared to their respective intact 
forages (0.32 vs. 0.23 and 0.46 vs. 0.22, 
respectively). There was no difference (P>0.05) in degradability of 
isolated and intact NDF in the other legumes. Cumulative gas production 
was nonlinearly related to NDF degradability (y = 15.5 ln(x) + 27.8; R2 = 0.94). Generally, the rate of gas production among the intact legumes was lower in tannin-containing legumes and C. ochroleuca compared to legumes with lower levelsof
 anti-nutritional compounds. Addition of PEG to fermentations of 
tannin-containing legumes significantly (P<0.05) improved the amount 
and rate of gas production compared to the respective non-PEG controls. 
Microbial protein synthesis was significantly higher (P<0.05) in C. calothyrsus, L. purpureus and C. ochroleuca than in the other legumes. L. purpureus and C. calothyrsus contained more sugar (131 and 154 g/kg
 DM, respectively) than the other forages. Tannins suppressed production
 of volatile fatty acids (VFA) compared to VFA production from forages 
with low levels of anti-nutritional factors (ANF). Addition of PEG 
increased VFA production from fermentation of tannin-containing forages.
 This study suggests that tannins and alkaloids in forages can adversely
 affect their fermentation characteristics and thereby their nutritive

production in many tropical agroecosystems where extensification rather 
than intensification of agriculture has occurred. In the highlands of 
western Kenya, we investigated soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) 
constraints to maize productivity across a cultivation chronosequence in
 which land‐use history ranged from recent conversion from primary 
forest to 100 years in continuous cropping. Nutrient treatments included
 a range of N and P fertilizer rates applied separately and in 
combination. Maize productivity without fertilizer was used as a proxy 
measure for indigenous soil fertility (ISF). Soil pools of mineral 
nitrogen, strongly bound P and plant‐available P decreased by 82%, 31% 
and 36%, and P adsorption capacity increased by 51% after 100 years of 
continuous cultivation. For the long rainy season (LR), grain yield 
without fertilizer declined rapidly as cultivation age increased from 0 
to 25 years and then gradually declined to a yield of 1.6 Mg ha−1,
 which was maintained as time under cultivation increased from 60 to 100
 years. LR grain yield in the old conversions was only 24% of the 
average young conversion grain yield (6.4 Mg ha−1). 
Application of either N or P alone significantly increased grain yield 
in both the LR and short rainy (SR) seasons, but only application of 
120 kg N ha−1 on the old conversion increased yield by >1 Mg ha−1.
 In both SR and LR, there was a greater average yield increment response
 to N and P when applied together (ranging from 1 to 3.8 Mg ha−1 for the LR), with the greatest responses on the old conversions. The benefit–cost ratio (BCR) for applying 120 kg N ha−1 alone was <1 except on the old conversions, while BCRs were>1 for applying 25 kg P ha−1 alone at all levels of conversion for both seasons. Application of both N (120 kg N ha−1) and P (25 kg P ha−1)
 on the old conversions resulted in the greatest BCRs. This study 
clearly indicates that maize productivity responses to N and P 
fertilizer are significantly affected by the age of cultivation and its 
influence on ISF, but that loss of productivity can be restored rapidly 
when these limiting nutrients are applied. Management strategies should

Two-dimensional micro- and nano-scale observations using synchrotron-based Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy yielded maps of the distribution of C amounts and chemical forms. Carbon deposits were unevenly distributed within microaggregates and did not show any discernable gradients between interior and exterior of aggregates. Rather, C deposits appeared to be patchy within the microaggregates. In contrast to the random location of C, there were micron-scale patterns in the spatial distribution of aliphatic C–H (2922 cm−1), aromatic C=C and N–H (1589 cm−1) and polysaccharide C–O (1035 cm−1). Aliphatic C forms and the ratio of aliphatic C/aromatic C were positively correlated (r 2 of 0.66–0.75 and 0.27–0.59, respectively) to the amount of O–H on kaolinite surfaces (3695 cm−1), pointing at a strong role for organo-mineral interactions in C stabilization within microaggregates and at a possible role for molecules containing aliphatic C-H groups in such interactions. This empirical relationship was supported by nanometer-scale observations using NEXAFS which showed that the organic matter in coatings on mineral surfaces had more aliphatic and carboxylic C with spectral characteristics resembling microbial metabolites than the organic matter of the entire microaggregate. Our observations thus support models of C stabilization in which the initially dominant process is adsorption of organics on mineral surfaces rather than occlusion of organic debris by adhering clay particles.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(population viability analysis) approach applies a diffusion 
approximation (DA) of population growth to time series of abundance data
 to estimate population parameters and various metrics of extinction 
risk. The simplest versions of this PVA assume density‐independent 
population growth, an assumption that is commonly called into question 
for populations experiencing self‐limitation. Using time series data 
generated from simulations of populations limited by three commonly used
 forms of density dependence (ceiling, Beverton‐Holt, and Ricker) we 
asked the question: “When do simple density‐independent PVA models 
provide useful guidelines for prioritizing extinction risk despite 
density‐dependence inherent in the underlying real populations?”
         Simple DA methods severely underestimated maximum growth rates (μmax)
 used to generate time series data for all three forms of density 
dependence. These methods also underestimated the intrinsic 
environmental variability in growth rates, or process error (σ2),
 for the ceiling model, but overestimated this parameter for the 
Beverton‐Holt and Ricker models. Despite misestimation of the intrinsic 
parameters, the estimated probabilities of 50% and 75% declines were 
highly correlated with the observed probabilities for populations 
growing with a ceiling (coefficients of correlation, or R 2 = 0.87–0.93). DA methods were less accurate for populations exhibiting more complex forms of density dependence (R 2
 = 0.61–0.79). Although correlations between observed and estimated 
risks were high, bias (e.g., over‐ and underestimation) was extensive. 
Estimated probabilities of 50% declines were typically much lower 
(overly optimistic) than observed probabilities of the same decline. By 
contrast, accuracy increased substantially for predictions of 75% 
decline, and the “optimistic” bias was replaced by conservative bias 
(overestimates of risk).
         Regardless of the form of density dependence, estimates of 
risk were least accurate when populations were recovering rapidly but 
were much more accurate when most needed by conservation practitioners: 
when the population fluctuated near its carrying capacity, recovered 
slowly to this abundance level, or declined toward extinction. Finally, 
when we classified risk in broad categories (e.g., extremely low, low, 
moderate, high, and extremely high), DA methods correctly or 
conservatively estimated the risk of a 75% decline for >85% of the 
parameter combinations, regardless of the form of density dependence 
followed by the real population.

By focusing on biomes and how well protected they are in the face of habitat conversion, this particular priority‐setting scheme provides a compelling case for a greater focus on temperate grasslands and Mediterranean woodlands. This is quite a contrast to the “biodiversity hotspot” credo that urges us to pour our efforts into tropical rainforests. Another alternative might be to emphasize the places that provide the greatest ecosystem services‐that approach would lead us to focus on Canada and Russia. And yet another calculation might factor in governance and corruption as a sort of “feasibility” index. It is pretty hard to establish the superiority of any one priority‐setting scheme over another. Many priority‐setting schemes make good sense and none of them can be “tested” or falsified in the usual spirit of science. They are simply different ways of looking at the world. Yet they have commanded numerous journal pages and hours of discussion. Personally, I am getting tired of such priority‐setting analyses and numerology (even though I have myself written papers on the topic). Here is why. The reality is that we need to do conservation everywhere. If we fail in any biome, we will have failed miserably. Perhaps the best approach would be to simply produce a map of where money is being spent on conservation and then make an effort to fill the gaps. Also, conservation is as much about strategies as it is about places. All this attention on prioritization maps ties up a lot of energy and may distract us from the tougher question of figuring out what  works as opposed to where  to work. Do not get me wrong‐I think those temperate grasslands and Mediterranean scrublands do need more effort than they are currently getting. But what really troubles me is that we do not have a map of where money is being spent by all the major players in conservation (see Jon Christensen's “The Uneasy Chair” in that same Fall 2004 issue of Conservation In Practice ).

Methods used to target areas for acquisition typically ignore land market dynamics. We show how conservation purchases affect land prices and generate feedbacks that can undermine conservation goals, either by displacing development toward biologically valuable areas or by accelerating its pace. The impact of these market feedbacks on the effectiveness of conservation depends on the ecological value of land outside nature reserves. Traditional, noneconomic approaches to site prioritization should perform adequately in places where land outside reserves supports little biodiversity. However, these approaches will perform poorly in locations where the countryside surrounding reserves is important for species’ persistence. Conservation investments can sometimes even be counterproductive, condemning more species than they save. Conservation is most likely to be compromised in the absence of accurate information on species distributions, which provides a strong argument for improving inventories of biodiversity.

In this article we develop guidelines to help steer conservation biologists and practitioners through the process of objective setting. We provide three case studies to highlight the practical challenges of objective setting in different social, political, and legal contexts.

Spatially and temporally fine‐scaled data from GPS radio collars show that elk moved into the protective cover of wooded areas when wolves were present, reducing their use of preferred grassland foraging habitats that had high predation risk. By constraining habitat selection, wolves may have greater effects on elk dynamics than would be predicted on the basis of direct predation alone. Based on changes in the woody vegetation following the reintroduction of wolves, it has been suggested that antipredator responses by elk may be driving a trophic cascade in the Yellowstone ecosystem. However, studies to date have been hampered by a lack of direct data on spatial variation in predation risk, and the ways in which elk respond to variation in risk. Our data support a central portion of the hypothesis that elk antipredator behavior could drive a trophic cascade, but changes in elk numbers are also likely to have affected elk–plant interactions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar battles are being fought over science, uncertainty, and wild animals in the American west, however, with far less attention to local epistemologies. Often dismissed as “barstool biology”, the ecological knowledges of local hunters in the Northern Yellowstone ecosystem are rooted in environmental experience and situated politics. How does local hunter knowledge diverge or converge with that of state officials, environmentalists, ranchers, and other constituencies, and to what effect on wildlife management policy? This paper seeks to answer that question, reviewing recent research amongst local resource users, managers, and activists in Montana. By rendering empirical the question of local knowledge around America’s oldest national park, rather than trying to “read it off” political affiliation, education, or livelihood, a clearer picture of power, knowledge, and conservation emerges.

Our main focus is on the role of private ranchland in elk ecology, and the ability of land owners to set elk migration in new directions through cumulative decisions about hunting and tolerating elk. This takes elk management, traditionally the purview of the state, out of administrative control. We document connections between the region’s historical and emerging land tenure patterns, and analyze associated changes in hunter access. Elk numbers expanded rapidly in the Upper Yellowstone Valley at a moment of significant transition in ranchland tenure. New owners more interested in natural amenities than in livestock production encouraged the elk and discouraged hunting. This reinforced the spread of elk, and further weakened the ability of the state and other ranchers to manage elk (which interfere with livestock production in numerous ways). Though elk and cattle use the landscape in similar ways, elk became more effective agents of landscape change in a reflexive relationship with ideas of land that stress natural amenities over production.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here I summarize the structure of HB and provide examples for common spatiotemporal problems. The flexible framework means that parameters, variables and latent variables can represent broader classes of model elements than are treated in traditional models. Inference and prediction depend on two types of stochasticity, including (1) uncertainty, which describes our knowledge of fixed quantities, it applies to all ‘unobservables’ (latent variables and parameters), and it declines asymptotically with sample size, and (2) variability, which applies to fluctuations that are not explained by deterministic processes and does not decline asymptotically with sample size.

grant.3029637,218001,Time in Service to Historical Ecology,2005,"Gragson, Ted L.",Georgia Journal of Ecological Anthropology,2,1,2,13,15Apr20,"Historical Ecology is one of the ascendant views in ecological and 
environmental anthropology. It originates in the intellectual 
transformation of history and ecology during the last 50 years, and 
seeped into anthropology in the last 10 to 15 years. Historical Ecology 
is increasingly recognized as one of the key approaches in the 
discipline helping to advance our understanding of what it means to be 
human. 
 There are numerous definitions of historical ecology, but 
the anthropological challenge is to place human decision-making, and the
 consciousness that drives it, at the center of our analyses of the 
human-environmental relationship (Crumley 1994, Whitehead 1998, Whitney 
1994). What this challenge entails is clear from a caricature of how the
 natural and social sciences view this relationship. In the natural 
sciences, humans are drivers of environmental change and there is little
 or no insight into the rationality behind any given transformation. In 
the social sciences, cognition and the resulting choices made by humans 
link them to their environment in a dialectical process of 
transformation. Humans as drivers of environmental change are nothing 
more than a problem to be disposed of; humans as coproducers with 
environment of the transformation offer the potential for altering the 
final outcome. 
 As is so often the case with emerging approaches 
there is debate as to whether historical ecology is a unified 
theoretical position or merely a research tool (Balée 1998, Whitehead 
1998). However, it can be productive to consider a different question 
emerging from our responsibility to manage Earth (Vitousek, Mooney, and 
Lubchenco 1997): How can anthropology participate in the collaborations 
needed to understand the neglected-to-engineered gradient of current 
environmental systems? Toward answering this question I first review the
 points of origin for historical ecology then examine how the essential 
properties of time can help center the practice of historical ecology on
 a problem and a place. The objective is to move historical ecology

We assessed differences in production of total suspended solids (TSS; ppm) from four road surface conditions in a Southern Appalachian watershed: (1) a 2-yr-old paved surface (P), (2) an improved gravel surface with controlled drainage and routine maintenance (RG), (3) an improved gravel surface with erosion and sediment control structures installed and routine maintenance (IG), and (4) an unimproved poorly maintained gravel surface (UG). Variation was high among and within road surface types. The P surface generated the least amount of TSS, which was comparable to control sites, while the UG surface generated the most. The P surface produced significantly less TSS than the UG surface, but not less than the IG and RG surfaces. Variation among road surface types was related to TSS travel distance below the road, precipitation amount, time of year, and the existence of functioning erosion and sediment control structures. TSS decreased with travel distance (P = -81% over 38.5 m, IG = -30% over 30.5 m, RG = -89% over 39.4 m, and UG = -22% over 28.1 m). Also in this study we assessed the delivery of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH; ppm) from the P surface and found concentrations of < 0.5 ppm, which are well below published USEPA and NC DENR TPH standards for sediment. Paving is an attractive option for reducing maintenance costs and sediment production and transport; however, levels of TPH from freshly applied asphalt are unknown. South. J. Appl.

We present a first-year account of suppression of oak seedlings in relation to Rhododendron and Kalmia basal area, light and resource availability, seedling performance and the rates of seedling damage (i.e., herbivory). We found no evidence of first-year seedling suppression or significant resource deficiencies beneath thickets of K. latifolia in mature mixed hardwood stands. Suppression beneath R. maximum was apparent during the first growing season. We found that seedling biomass, light availability prior to canopy closure, and seedling tissue C:N ratios were negatively correlated with R. maximum basal area. Basal area of R. maximum was positively correlated with seedling mortality rates, soil [Al], and early-growing season leaf herbivory rates. Seedling growth was positively correlated with light and tissue C:N, while negatively correlated with soil [Al]. Overall, our results support the inhibition model of shade-mediated carbon limitation beneath dense understory shrubs and indicate the potential importance of herbivory and aluminum toxicity as components of a suppression mechanism beneath R. maximum thickets. We present a causal model of first year inhibition beneath R. maximum in the context of our findings and the results of prior studies.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even if a population disperses to a new region with a favorable climate, interactions with other species may prevent its establishment and further spread. The potential of these species to grow along with residents will be a critical factor controlling their response to climate change. To determine the capacity of migrating species to colonize established communities we conducted extensive long‐term transplant experiments where potential tree migrant species, i.e. species within ‘migration range,’ were planted side by side with resident ones. Potential immigrants were selected to be representative species of their native communities. For both groups, residents and potential migrants (17 species), we compared their growth response along gradients in soil moisture and light availability. Rather than manipulate climate directly, we exploited natural microclimatic gradients and the fluctuations in climate that occurred during the 5‐year experiment. Experimental results were used to estimate growth in the context of novel climate and relevant establishment factors. Results suggest that potential immigrant species had similar growth rates in the new environment than those from resident species ensuring their ability to establish in the area. However, contrary to our expectations, the soil moisture requirements for the immigrant group were similar to those of the resident species. These results could have major implications for vegetation changes under the predicted drier climate for the region. If it is the case that neither resident species nor potential migrants are able to maintain stable populations, the region may experience a decline in local biodiversity.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clark",Forest Ecology and Management,3,3,3,83,9Apr20,"There is growing recognition of the role of mechanistic scaling laws in shaping ecological pattern and process. While such theoretical relationships explain much of the variation across large scales, at any particular scale there is important residual variation that is left unexplained among species, among individuals within a species, and within individuals themselves. Key questions remain on what explains this variability and how we can apply this information in practice, in particular to produce estimates in high-diversity systems with many rare and under-sampled species. We apply hierarchical Bayes statistical techniques to data on crown geometry from diverse temperate forests in order to simultaneously model the differences within and among species. We find that tree height, canopy depth, and canopy radius are affected by both successional stage and wood mechanical strength, while tree height conforms to the predicted 2/3 power relationship. Furthermore, we show that hierarchical modeling allows us to constrain the allometries of rare species much more than traditional methods. Finally, crown radius was shown to vary substantially more within individuals than among individuals or species, suggesting that the capacity for local light foraging and crown plasticity exerts the dominant control on tree crowns.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated linkages between landscapes and assemblages in 31 wadeable Piedmont streams in the Etowah River basin in northern Georgia (USA). Our objectives were to identify the indicators of macroinvertebrate and fish integrity from a large set of best land cover (n = 45), geomorphology (n = 115), and water quality (n = 12) variables, and to evaluate the potential for variables measured with minimal cost and effort to effectively predict biotic integrity. Macroinvertebrate descriptors were better predicted by land cover whereas fish descriptors were better predicted by geomorphology. Water quality variables demonstrated moderate levels of predictive power for biotic descriptors. Macroinvertebrate descriptors were best predicted by urban cover (−), conductivity (−), fines in riffles (−), and local relief (+). Fish descriptors were best predicted by embeddedness (−), turbidity (−), slope (+), and forest cover (+). We used multiple linear regression modeling to predict descriptors using three independent variable sets that varied in difficulty of data collection. “Full” models included a full range of geomorphic, water quality and landscape variables regardless of the intensity of data collection efforts. “Reduced” models included GIS-derived variables describing catchment morphometry and land use as well as variables easily collected in the field with minimal cost and effort. “Simple” models only included GIS-derived variables. Full models explained 63–81% of the variation among descriptors, indicating strong relationships between landscape properties and biotic assemblages across our sites. Reduced and simple models were weaker, explaining 48–79% and 42–79%, respectively, of the variance among descriptors. Considering the difference in predictive power among these model sets, we recommend a tiered approach to variable selection and model development depending upon management goals. GIS variables are simple and inexpensive to collect, and a GIS-based modeling approach would be appropriate for goals such as site screening (e.g., identification of reference streams). As management goals become more complex (e.g., long-term monitoring programs), additional, easily collected field variables (e.g., embeddedness) should be included. Finally, labor-intensive variables (e.g., nutrients and fines in sediments) could be added to meet complex management goals such as restoration of impaired streams or mechanistic studies of land use effects on stream ecosystems.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

fourth, the control, consisted of two uncut sites (UC). Each harvest 
treatment was replicated three times across the landscape in similar 
plant community types. Within each treatment area, permanent plots were 
marked and inventoried for overstory, midstory, and herbaceous layer 
plants. In each permanent plot, we collected soil samples in winter 
(December–March) to reduce temporal variation due to vegetation

extractable calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), cation exchange
 capacity (CEC), pH, bulk density, A-horizon depth, total carbon (C),

NMS) to explore the changes in vegetation–site relationships among 
herbaceous layer abundance, and soil characteristics and overstory basal
 area between pre-harvest (1994) and post-harvest (2000). Twelve minor 
overstory species were cut from the 2A treatments and nine species were 
cut from the SW treatments. Thus, it is not surprising that S and H′
 were reduced in the overstory on the heavily cut sites. However, most 
of these species sprouted from cut stumps and were substantially more 
abundant in the midstory layer after harvest than before. For the 
midstory, we found higher S and H′ on the harvested treatments than the control; however, H′ did not differ significantly among the harvest treatments. We measured an increase in herbaceous layer H′

an increase in average distance in the NMS ordination among sites in

Leaf breakdown rates of 4 tree species (Acer rubrum, Carpinus caroliniana, Juglans nigra, and Platanus occidentalis) ranged from 0.001 to 0.010/d. We separated the 12 sites into 2 groups (inundated and non-inundated) based on the degree of flooding after a flood on 8 January 1998 and determined POM exchange between the active channel and floodplain. Significant transport of leaves from the floodplain to the river occurred at inundated sites, but transport of herbaceous or woody material did not occur. The flood increased leaf breakdown rates of all 4 tree species. Our measurements of litterfall, leaf breakdown, and floodplain litter standing crop suggest that leaves entrained from the floodplain of Little Tennessee River during floods are a source of POM to the active channel.

Five watersheds had areas of recent suburban development proximal to stream sites, and 5 watersheds were not currently undergoing suburban development. We estimated 5 hydrological, 10 geomorphological, 6 erosional, and 3 depositional (i.e., substrate) variables, and 13 fish and 8 macroinvertebrate metrics in the study sites. We used Student’s t-tests and multivariate analysis of variance to compare the 45 variables between sites in agricultural and suburban watersheds. We used Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) to detect subtle differences in taxonomic composition and abundance among watersheds. Stormflow total suspended solids were significantly lower and substrate inorganic matter content was significantly higher in streams influenced by suburban development. Fish taxa richness and the density of nonguarding fishes were significantly higher in sites in suburban watersheds than in sites in agricultural watersheds. No other fish or macroinvertebrate metric differed with respect to watershed land use, but ordination of sites by fish and macroinvertebrate species abundance suggested that biotic assemblages at sites in suburban watersheds were distinct from those at sites in agricultural watersheds. Therefore, some taxa may have been influenced by suburban development. Our results suggest that watershed hydrology, sediment delivery, and sediment composition might be important factors influencing biota in streams draining agricultural vs suburban watersheds. Biological assemblages in streams differed structurally with respect to watershed land use, but streams did not appear to be otherwise influenced by suburban development. We conclude that suburbanization near historically agricultural southern Appalachian streams induces subtle changes to inorganic sediment dynamics, substrate composition, and fish and macroinvertebrate assemblage structure.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The associations of benthic (periphyton-dominated) biomass with concentrations of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus in rural and urban streams in New York were quantified. Biomass was significantly greater (2-fold) in the urban compared with the rural stream, which was associated with differences in dissolved nutrients. Experimental field enrichment of nutrient concentrations and duration of exposure altered benthic periphyton. Increasing nutrients by 60–99% of ambient concentrations increased periphyton percentage cover and biomass. Periphyton abundance also increased with increasing duration of exposure to nutrients (2, 4 and 8 weeks); however, short-term pulses of nutrients (2 weeks) had no significant effect in the rural stream.

We assessed perceptions and values associated with two less often considered ecological outcomes of dreissenid mussel influences on coastal ecosystems along Lake Ontario and the western St. Lawrence River in New York State. One, the generation of water clarity through filtration, we define as an ecosystem service; the other, the production of large amounts of nuisance algae (e.g., Cladophora and Microcystis) is defined as an ecosystem disservice. Surveys of business owners and homeowners quantified their preferences and the formation of values regarding these products of zebra mussel influence. Water clarity increased greatly, particularly in the eastern portion of Lake Ontario, and algal problems increased throughout. Businesses attributed increases and decreases in revenues associated with water clarity and algae; homeowners reported analogous changes in property values. Water clarity was positively associated, and algae negatively associated, with changes in revenues and property values. Threshold responses of costs as functions of filamentous algae were evident.

The predominance of small American eels (<200 mm) and wide range of ages (from young-of-year glass eels to 24-year-old yellow eels) suggest that tributaries are an important nursery area for immature American eels. However, upstream of natural and artificial barriers, American eel densities were reduced by at least a factor of 10 and condition, as measured by mass, was significantly lower. Significantly lower American eel condition was also found with increasing riparian urbanization.

Cod (Gadus morhua), which is one of the most abundant fish species in the bone assemblage, was probably caught with hook and line fishing. To investigate the fishhooks' field of application, a morphological and morphometric study was performed on 384 available hooks. Two sets of replicas made of four selected original fishhooks were submitted to a strength test. A breakage study of the incomplete hooks in comparison with the strength-tested hooks was carried out in order to distinguish fresh breaks from dry breaks. It seems that a certain morphology for fishhooks was preferred at Ajvide, indicating they were produced by skilled craftsmen for special usage. The strength test showed that the hooks had a weight bearing capacity more than the average size of cod caught at Ajvide. Using results of these tests, we predicted that the mean breaking strength of 46 intact Ajvide hooks was 96.6 ± 26.1 (s.d.) Newtons (equivalent to 9.85 ± 2.7 kg). The design of fishhooks changed somewhat over time, being slightly larger in the oldest layers of the site. The breakage patterns of the hooks show that the bow was the most common area of breakage.

The watershed was almost entirely forested in 1609, with minor amounts of Indian agriculture. By 1880, approximately 68% of the watershed was farmland, but as soil productivity declined and industry created other jobs, much cleared land gradually reverted to secondary forest. Most land not in agriculture was forested, and was exploited first for lumber and tanbark, and later on, pulpwood for paper. The tanning industry existed from the 1700s but reached its height in the mid-1800s, collapsing from a combination of resource (hemlock) exhaustion and market forces.

We monitored massive upstream migrations of Neritina virginea for 99 weeks, and conducted a detailed study of snail density, size, and hydraulic descriptors in lower Río Mameyes, northeastern Puerto Rico. The study assessed the 1) timing and seasonality of upstream migration, 2) size composition of migratory aggregations, 3) patterns of habitat use, and 4) role of floods on upstream migration. Massive upstream migrations (500–3000 ind/m2) were observed in 44 of 99 weeks of observation. While N. virginea aggregations occurred at random time intervals, they were clumped during rainy periods. Migratory aggregations consisted mostly of small individuals (5–7 mm). Greater mean density was consistently observed in a stable riffle than in an unstable run (115.7 and 17.8 ind/m2, respectively), but mean density increased and mean size reduced in both reaches during the first 7 upstream migratory events. N. virginea density and size dynamics differed between reaches as a function of habitat hydraulics. While juveniles used the stable riffle as a permanent habitat and preferred passageway, they also used an adjacent, unstable reach after storm events. Density variation was correlated with days postflood (>3.5 m3/s) in both reaches. Our observations indicated that massive upstream migrations of N. virginea juveniles occur at least once a month, presumably as habitat-dependent responses to floods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microbial colonization, or conditioning, makes leaf litter more nutritional and palatable to stream detritivores, but few studies have investigated the relative importance of litter source to macroshredders in tropical streams. We determined the source (terrestrial, aquatic, or aerial), quantity, and species composition of allochthonous inputs into the Quebrada Prieta, a tropical headwater stream in Puerto Rico, as a first step toward understanding the importance of conditioning history to rates of tropical leaf-litter processing by decapod consumers. Fresh leaves of 4 common species of leaves were treated by exposing them to different conditions for 2 wk. These exposure treatments (conditioning histories) represented routes by which leaves might enter streams and included submersion (aquatic input), incubation on the streambank soil (terrestrial input), and suspension above the ground (aerial input). Conditioned leaves were placed in small experimental microcosms with or without shrimp (Xiphocariselongata) for 20 d. Shrimp significantly increased the rate of decomposition of all leaf species independent of conditioning history. Conditioning history had little effect on breakdown rates independent of the presence of shrimp. One species (Roureasurinamensis) had faster mass loss when the leaves were conditioned as aquatic inputs rather than as terrestrial or aerial inputs. Our results indicate that conditioning history has little effect on the ability of some macroconsumers to alter detrital foodweb dynamics in tropical streams. Tropical stream ecosystems may function differently from temperate ecosystems because of the dominance of large detritivores such as shrimps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, economists have had few tools to perform economic analysis on adaptive natural resource management strategies and there has been limited economic analysis of adaptive management. Part of the reason for this situation may be the inherent nature of adaptive management which involves a series of ‘if-then’ in situ experiments in which expected outputs are not known with certainty, and future management actions depend on the outcome of the experiments. Individual agent-based modelling allows simulation of system wide emergent ecosystem properties that can reflect adaptation of individual agents with bounded rationality to their environment and to the interaction with other agents. These simulations can be used to mimic adaptive management experiments when insufficient information is available for more structured equation-based simulation models. The distribution of simulated outputs from individual agent-based models along with costs of the management actions may give economists the ability to better apply economic analysis to evaluate alternative adaptive management strategies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Near‐bed water velocity, snail density and shell size were measured on a weekly basis between August and December 2000 along cross‐sections in a main channel (MC) and an adjacent channel (SC) under a bridge crossing of the Río Mameyes of Northeastern Puerto Rico. Near‐bed velocity and water depth were used to compute Reynolds (Re) and Froude (Fr) numbers, and to classify flows within each channel. During base flow conditions (<2 m3 s−1), flow was chaotic and supercritical (Fr > 1) in the MC, and non‐chaotic and subcritical (Fr < 1) in the SC. Higher mean densities (>100 ind m−2) of relatively small snails (mean ± s.d., 6.3 ± 2.8 mm) were consistently recorded in the MC. Conversely, the SC had lower mean densities (<20 ind m−2) and significantly larger snails (7.6 ± 2.4 mm). Within the MC, migratory groups preferred near‐bed velocities > 0.8 m s−1. Within the SC, they preferred the channel thalweg and depths > 30 cm. The spatial arrangement that was observed between and within the channels may be related to food resources, predation pressure or biomechanics. Characteristics of preferred upstream migration pathways of N. virginea must be accounted when building road crossings in coastal streams with diadromous fauna.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Optimum visitor use to maximize visitor defined satisfaction is a more constraining limit on visitor use than water quality. Our multiple regression analysis suggests that visitor use of about 150 visitors per day yields the highest level of visitor reported satisfaction, a level that does not appear to affect turbidity of the river. This high level of visitor use may be related to the gregarious nature of Puerto Ricans and their tolerance for crowding on this densely populated island.

Although gradually improving environmental conditions provided sufficient resources to permit the subdivision of preexisting territories, regional lion populations did not expand until short-term conditions supplied enough prey to generate large cohorts of surviving young.

However, the relationship between the spatial distribution of limiting nutrients and species diversity is not well established because there is no single scale appropriate for measuring variation in resource distribution. Instead, the correct scale for analyzing resource variation depends on the range of species sizes within the community. To quantify the relationship between nutrient distribution and plant species diversity, we measured NO3 - distribution and plant species diversity in 16 paired, modified Whittaker grassland plots in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Semivariograms were used to quantify the spatial structure of NO3 - from scales of 0.4–26 m. Plant species diversity (Shannon-Weiner diversity index; H ′) was quantified in 1-m2 plots, while plant species richness was measured at multiple spatial scales between 1 and 1,000 m2. Small-scale variation in NO3 - (<0.4 m) was positively correlated with 1-m2 H ′, while 1,000-m2 species richness was a log-normal function of average NO3 - patch size. Nine of the 16 grassland plots had a fractal (self-similar across scales) NO3 - spatial distribution; of the nine fractal plots, five were adjacent to plots that had a non-fractal distribution of NO3 -. This finding offered the unique opportunity to test predictions of Ritchie and Olff (1999): when the spatial distribution of limiting resources is fractal, communities should display a left-skewed log-size distribution and a log-normal relationship between net primary production and species richness. These predictions were supported by comparisons of plant size distributions and biomass-richness relationships in paired plots, one with a fractal and one with a non-fractal distribution of NO3 -. In addition, fractal plots had greater large-scale richness than paired non-fractal plots (1,0–1000 m2), but neither species diversity (H ′) nor richness was significantly different at small scales (1 m2). This result is most likely explained by differences in the scale of resource variation among plots: fractal and non-fractal plots had equivalent NO3 - variation at small scales but differed in NO3 - variation at large scales (as measured by the fractal dimension). We propose that small-scale variation in NO3 - is largely due to the direct effects of plants on soil, while patterns of species richness at large scales is controlled by the patch size and fractal dimension of NO3 - in the landscape. This study provides an important empirical step in understanding the relationship between the spatial distribution of resources and patterns of species diversity across multiple spatial scales.",Title reported in NSF does not match journal citation.

Predictions for open systems, i.e. those with cross‐habitat nutrient fluxes and dispersal, may differ from those expected in closed systems, where no such transfers occur, but these differences have only recently begun to be characterized. We present a theoretical model of plant productivity and soil nitrogen (N) based on the Serengeti ecosystem in order to investigate the interplay among herbivore movement, nutrient transport across habitats (spatial subsidies), the fire regime and the effects of herbivores on N cycling. Model results suggest that the fire regime and herbivore migration are key determinants of primary productivity and fertility, and that the impact of these factors depends on grazing intensity. At low intensity, high grass biomass leads to extensive fires and N volatilization, but this effect is reduced at high grazing intensity. Without migration, the model predicts that primary productivity and fertility initially increase, then decline with increasing grazing intensity. Conversely, seasonal migration decouples the growing and grazing seasons, leading to a monotonic increase in productivity with grazing intensity. Cross‐habitat N transport has a relatively modest effect on N dynamics, and the magnitude of the seasonality effect outweighs the spatial subsidy effect. Our model suggests that herbivores and fire may play key interactive 
roles in regulating producers and determining ecosystem functional 
properties in grazing systems, both through consumption and via indirect
 effects on nutrient availability. The direction and magnitude of these 
effects could potentially vary greatly among ecosystems with resident 
vs. migratory herbivores, suggesting that spatial coupling through 
animal movement can be important at both the population and ecosystem 
levels.This study suggests that the degree to which trophic interactions 
influence ecosystem function may be strongly modulated by whether 
systems are open or closed. It also suggests that direct and indirect 
effects of consumers on their resources (top‐down effects) may be far 
more important than nutrient subsidies in open terrestrial systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grant.3037334,308486,Group formation stabilizes predator-prey dynamics in Serengeti,2007,Fryxell et al. ,Nature,3,3,3,197,19Mar20,"Theoretical ecology is largely founded on the principle of mass action, in which uncoordinated populations of predators and prey move in a random and well-mixed fashion across a featureless landscape. The conceptual core of this body of theory is the functional response, predicting the rate of prey consumption by individual predators as a function of predator and/or prey densities1,2,3,4,5. This assumption is seriously violated in many ecosystems in which predators and/or prey form social groups. Here we develop a new set of group-dependent functional responses to consider the ecological implications of sociality and apply the model to the Serengeti ecosystem. All of the prey species typically captured by Serengeti lions (Panthera leo) are gregarious, exhibiting nonlinear relationships between prey-group density and population density. The observed patterns of group formation profoundly reduce food intake rates below the levels expected under random mixing, having as strong an impact on intake rates as the seasonal migratory behaviour of the herbivores. A dynamical system model parameterized for the Serengeti ecosystem (using wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) as a well-studied example) shows that grouping strongly stabilizes interactions between lions and wildebeest. Our results suggest that social groups rather than individuals are the basic building blocks around which predator–prey interactions should be modelled and that group formation may provide the underlying stability of many ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the effects of excluding ungulate herbivores on plant species richness and composition, as well as available soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), across eight grassland sites in Serengeti National Park (SNP), Tanzania. These sites varied independently in rainfall and available soil N and P. Excluding herbivores decreased plant species richness at all sites and by an average of 5.4 species across all plots. Although plant species richness was a unimodal function of rainfall in both grazed and ungrazed plots, fences caused a greater decrease in plant species richness at sites of intermediate rainfall compared to sites of high or low rainfall. In terms of the relative or proportional decreases in plant species richness, excluding herbivores caused the strongest relative decreases at lower rainfall and where exclusion of herbivores increased available soil P. Herbivore exclusion increased among‐plot heterogeneity in species composition but decreased coexistence of congeneric grasses. Compositional similarity between grazed and ungrazed treatments decreased with increasing rainfall due to greater forb richness in exclosures and greater sedge richness outside exclosures and was not related to effects of excluding herbivores on soil nutrients. Our results show that plant resources, especially water and P, appear to modulate the effects of herbivores on tropical grassland plant diversity and composition. We show that herbivore effects on soil P may be an important and previously unappreciated mechanism by which herbivores influence plant diversity, at least in tropical grasslands.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fire and herbivory effects on the nutritive quality of savanna vegetation can occur directly, independent of changes in the plant community, or indirectly, via effects on the plant community. Indirect effects can be further subdivided into those occurring because of changes in plant species composition or plant abundance (i.e., quality versus quantity). We studied relationships between fire, herbivory, rainfall, soil fertility, and leaf nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sodium (Na) at 30 sites inside and outside of Serengeti National Park. Using structural equation modeling, we asked whether fire and herbivory influences were largely direct or indirect and how their signs and strengths differed within the context of natural savanna processes. Herbivory was associated with enhanced leaf N and P through changes in plant biomass and community composition. Fire was associated with reduced leaf nutrient concentrations through changes in plant community composition. Additionally, fire had direct positive effects on Na and nonlinear direct effects on P that partially mitigated the indirect negative effects. Key mechanisms by which fire reduced plant nutritive quality were through reductions of Na‐rich grasses and increased abundance of Themeda triandra, which had below‐average leaf nutrients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It remains unclear whether this process has important effects in mature natural ecosystems where competitive feedbacks and complex environmental influences affect diversity–productivity relationships. In this study, we evaluated diversity–productivity relationships while statistically controlling for environmental influences in 12 natural grassland ecosystems. Because diversity–productivity relationships are conspicuously nonlinear, we developed a nonlinear structural equation modeling (SEM) methodology to separate the effects of diversity on productivity from the effects of productivity on diversity. Meta‐analysis was used to summarize the SEM findings across studies. While competitive effects were readily detected, enhancement of production by diversity was not. These results suggest that the influence of small‐scale diversity on productivity in mature natural systems is a weak force, both in absolute terms and relative to the effects of other controls on productivity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kliskey",Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation,1,1,1,12,16Apr2020,"This paper presents a model, using concepts from artificial neural networks, that explains how small rural communities make decisions that affect access to potable freshwater. Field observations indicate that social relationships as well as individual goals and perceptions of decision makers have a strong influence on decisions that are made by community councils. Our work identifies three types of agents, which we designate as alpha, beta, and gamma agents. We address how gamma agents affect decisions made by community councils in passing resolutions that benefit a village's collective access to clean freshwater. The model, which we call the Agent Types Model (ATM), demonstrates the effects of social interactions, corporate influence, and agent-specific factors that determine choices for agents. Data from two different villages in rural Alaska and several parameter sensitivity tests are applied to the model. Results demonstrate that minimizing the social significance and agent-specific factors affecting gamma agents' negative compliance increases the likelihood that communities adopt measures promoting potable freshwater access. The significance of this work demonstrates which types of communities are potentially more socially vulnerable or resilient to social-ecological change affecting water supplies.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proponents claim they are key to reducing hunger and negative environmental impacts of agriculture. Opponents claim they will have the opposite effect. The risk management process (RMP) is the primary way in which TGVs are regulated in the US (and many other industrial countries), and proponents claim that the findings of that process in the US and its regulatory consequences should be extended to TBAS. However, TBAS differ in important ways from industrial agriculture, so TGVs could have different effects in TBAS, and farmers there may evaluate risks and benefits differently. To evaluate some potential impacts of TGVs in TBAS we used the RMP as a framework for the case of Bt maize in Mesoamerica and Cuba. We interviewed 334 farmers in Cuba, Guatemala and Mexico about farming practices, evaluations of potential harm via hypothetical scenarios, and ranking of maize types. Results suggest high potential for transgene flow via seed, grain and pollen; differences in effects of this exposure in TBAS compared with industrial agriculture; farmers see some potential consequences as harmful. Perceptions of harm differ among farmers in ways determined by their farming systems, and are different from those commonly assumed in industrial systems.

This phenomenon is apparent in the case of tejate, one of a family of beverages made with maize and cacao that have a very long history in Mesoamerica. Today, tejate is arguably the most important traditional drink in the Central Valleys region of Oaxaca, in southern Mexico. It is commonly made with maize, seeds of one or two species of cacao, seeds of mamey, and rosita de cacao blossoms. Analysis of tejate's current role and its relationship with farmer‐named maize diversity in two communities of the Central Valleys, one less and one more indigenous, reveals that the preparation of tejate is positively associated with greater local maize diversity. At the same time, it suggests that this relationship could change as a result of contemporary globalization, in which tejate has become more popular with urban consumers and has moved to the United States with Oaxacan migrants. Tejate is an example of the persistence and change of an important traditional food over time—its origins in indigenous America made possible by interregional migration and trade, its persistence and change through European colonization and independence, its decline during late‐twentieth‐century economic globalization, and its current change and expansion in an era of intensified globalization.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mathematically, the system dynamics is described by two nonlinear diffusion–reaction equations in two spatial dimensions. Regimes of invasion are studied by means of extensive numerical simulations. We show that, in this system, along with well-known scenarios of species spread via propagation of continuous population fronts, there exists an essentially different invasion regime which we call a patchy invasion. In this regime, the species spreads over space via irregular motion and interaction of separate population patches without formation of any continuous front, the population density between the patches being nearly zero. We show that this type of the system dynamics corresponds to spatiotemporal chaos and calculate the dominant Lyapunov exponent. We then show that, surprisingly, in the regime of patchy invasion the spatially average prey density appears to be below the survival threshold. We also show that a variation of parameters can destroy this regime and either restore the usual invasion scenario via propagation of continuous fronts or brings the species to extinction; thus, the patchy spread can be qualified as the invasion at the edge of extinction.

We add a list of cases in which there has been evidence that intra-taxon hybridization has preceded the evolution of invasiveness. We also provide a number of examples from organisms other than plants. We consider how our examples suggest mechanisms whereby hybridization may act to stimulate the evolution of invasiveness.

Opponents of GE crops often assume that risk management is inappropriate for the Third World, because it is inherently biased in favor of the industrial world. We examine both of these assumptions, by rethinking risk management for GE crops and transgenes, using the example of maize transgene flow from the U.S. to Mexico. Risk management for the Third World is a necessary first step of a broader benefit–cost analysis of GE crops, which would include comparisons with existing varieties and with alternative varieties such as transgenic farmer varieties and organic varieties. Our goal is to use existing information on GE crops and on the social and biological characteristics of Third World agriculture to identify key processes that need to be considered in risk management, and the additional research required to adequately understand them. The four main steps in risk management are hazard identification, risk analysis (exposure x harm), risk evaluation, and risk treatment. We use informal event trees to identify possible exposure to GE crops and transgenes, and resulting biological and social harm; give examples of farmers’ ability to evaluate social harm; and discuss the possibilities for risk treatment. We conclude that risk management is relevant for Third World agriculture, but needs to be based on the unique biological and social characteristics of small-scale, traditionally based agriculture, including the knowledge and values of Third World farmers and consumers.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Without costly research on the variables determining gene flow, research on transgene frequencies in landrace (or wild relative) populations can be valuable for understanding transgene flow and its effects. Minimal research requirements include (1) understanding how farmer practices and seed systems affect landrace populations, (2) sampling to optimize Ne/n (effective /census population size), (3) minimizing variance at all levels sampled, and (4) using Ne to calculate binomial probabilities for transgene frequencies. A key case is maize in Mexico. Two peer-reviewed papers, based on landrace samples from the Sierra Juárez region of Oaxaca, Mexico, reached seemingly conflicting conclusions: transgenes are present (Quist and Chapela, 2001, Nature 414: 541–543; 2002, Nature 416: 602) or “detectable transgenes” are absent (Ortiz-García et al., 2005, Proc.

We conclude that if Quist and Chapela’s results showing presence are accepted, Ortiz-García et al.’s conclusions of no evidence of transgenes at detectable levels or for their introgression into maize landraces in the Sierra de Juárez of Oaxaca are not scientifically justified. This is because their samples are not representative, and their statistical analysis is inconclusive due to using n instead of Ne. Using estimates of Ne based on Ortiz-García et al.’s n, we estimate that transgenes could be present in maize landraces in the Sierra Juárez region at frequencies of ~1–4%, and are more likely to be present in the 90% of Oaxacan landrace area that is not mountainous. Thus, we have no scientific evidence of maize transgene presence or absence in recent years in Mexico, Oaxaca State, or the Sierra Juárez region.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expanding role of these economic “teleconnections” (coupled phenomena that take place in distant places on the planet) led to a 3‐year period (2002–2004) of historically high deforestation rates. But it also increases the potential for large‐scale conservation in the region as markets and finance institutions demand better environmental and social performance of beef and soy producers. Cattle ranchers and soy farmers who have generally opposed ambitious government regulations that require forest reserves on private property are realizing that good land stewardship—including compliance with legislation—may increase their access to expanding domestic and international markets and to credit and lower the risk of “losing” their land to agrarian reform. The realization of this potential depends on the successful negotiation of social and environmental performance criteria and an associated system of certification that are acceptable to both the industries and civil society.

Expanding global demands for biofuels and grains, positive feedbacks in the Amazon forest fire regime and drought may drive a faster process of forest degradation that could lead to a near-term forest dieback. Rising worldwide demands for biofuel and meat are creating powerful new incentives for agro-industrial expansion into Amazon forest regions. Forest fires, drought and logging increase susceptibility to further burning while deforestation and smoke can inhibit rainfall, exacerbating fire risk. If sea surface temperature anomalies (such as El Niño episodes) and associated Amazon droughts of the last decade continue into the future, approximately 55% of the forests of the Amazon will be cleared, logged, damaged by drought or burned over the next 20 years, emitting 15–26 Pg of carbon to the atmosphere. Several important trends could prevent a near-term dieback. As fire-sensitive investments accumulate in the landscape, property holders use less fire and invest more in fire control. Commodity markets are demanding higher environmental performance from farmers and cattle ranchers. Protected areas have been established in the pathway of expanding agricultural frontiers.

We review the potential for this mechanism [reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD)] to provoke ecological damages and promote ecological cobenefits. Nations could potentially participate in REDD by slowing clear‐cutting of mature tropical forest, slowing or decreasing the impact of selective logging, promoting forest regeneration and restoration, and expanding tree plantations. REDD could also foster efforts to reduce the incidence of forest fire. Potential ecological costs include the accelerated loss (through displaced agricultural expansion) of low‐biomass, high‐conservation‐value ecosystems, and substitution of low‐biomass vegetation by monoculture tree plantations. These costs could be avoided through measures that protect low‐biomass native ecosystems. Substantial ecological cobenefits should be conferred under most circumstances, and include the maintenance or restoration of (1) watershed functions, (2) local and regional climate regimes, (3) soils and biogeochemical processes, (4) water quality and aquatic habitat, and (5) terrestrial habitat. Some tools already being developed to monitor, report and verify (MRV) carbon emissions performance can also be used to measure other elements of ecosystem function, making development of MRV systems for ecological cobenefits a concrete possibility. Analysis of possible REDD program interventions in a large‐scale Amazon landscape indicates that even modest flows of forest carbon funding can provide substantial cobenefits for aquatic ecosystems, but that the functional integrity of the landscape's myriad small watersheds would be best protected under a more even spatial distribution of forests. Because of its focus on an ecosystem service with global benefits, REDD could access a large pool of global stakeholders willing to pay to maintain carbon in forests, thereby providing a potential cascade of ecosystem services to local stakeholders who would otherwise be unable to afford them.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We find that, irrespective of distance to markets, smallholders that have either been settled by INCRA or have access to credit are more likely to sell wood, but those with outside income sources are less likely to sell. Higher timber prices decrease the likelihood of timber sales. The results suggest that timber sales are viewed only as a means for smallholders to reduce immediate cash constraints.

Models  designed  to  simulate  deforestation  should therefore incorporate a demographic dynamics system to help project the influence of these variables on the location and rates of deforestation across the basin. We present a demographic model that projects population at municipality level by computing migratory movements among Brazilian Amazon municipalities, both in and out of the region, as well as their crude birth and mortality rates. The annual projections from 1995 to 2035 are based mainly on mortality, fertility, and migration data from the 1991 and 2000 IBGE censuses. The model assumes a logistic curve to project the municipalities’ crude birth and mortality rates, which are obtained using specific functions of fertility and mortality by age. The migratory movements were determined  by  establishing  an  origin-destination  matrix  for  all the  Brazilian  Amazon municipalities and Brazilian states from 1995 to 2000. Vensim, a system-thinking software which allows for the solution of simultaneous equations for the 810 defined spatial units by employing integration techniques, such as the Runge-Kutta method, is used to implement the simulation model.

The Maine lobster fishery is an instructive example of biological and technological circumstances combining with individual self-interest to create conditions favorable to collective action. The model describes the way social structure emerges from the adaptive behavior of competing fishers. Fishers compete in two ways: in a scramble to find the lobsters first and by directly interfering in other fishers' ability to compete, i.e., by cutting their traps. Both forms of competition lead fishers to interact frequently and to self-organize into relatively small groups. They learn to restrain their competitive behavior toward their neighbors but do not extend that same restraint to nonneighbors. Groups work within well defined boundaries, contact one another frequently, actively exchange information about the resource, and, most importantly, depend on continuing mutual restraint for their economic well-being. These self-organizing, competitive processes lay the foundation for successful collective action, i.e., mutual agreements that create the additional restraint required for conservation. The modeling approach we use is a combined multiagent and classifier systems simulation. The model allows us to simulate the dynamic adaptation (learning) of multiple individuals interacting in a complex, changing environment and, consequently, provides a way to analyze the fine-scale processes that emerge as the broad social–ecological patterns of the fishery. Patterns generated by the model are compared with patterns observed in a large dataset collected by 44 Maine fishers.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fishing captains continuously sample the environment and decide where to allocate fishing effort in a dynamic process influenced by a variety of ecological factors. I instituted a participatory, observational study of 15 teams fishing for the red spiny lobster, Panulirus interruptus (Randall, 1840), in Baja California Sur, Mexico, where trap locations, lobster catch, and trap movement were recorded daily. I analyzed 8407 trap-placement decisions to quantify attributes of fishing strategies, including search frequency and Cartesian behavior, by interpolating maps of resource abundance based on fishers' own catch and using them to evaluate trap placement. All fishers preferentially placed traps in areas with higher catch rates the previous day, and the extent to which fishers did so explained season-wide differences in catch success. Other explanatory factors included the distance fishers moved traps that caught no lobsters, the number of traps checked per day, and the proportion of traps they used to explore new areas. Different attributes of fishing strategy were more important in explaining catch success in the two fishing areas studied, presumably because of different spatial relations of benthic habitats and their effects on lobster movement patterns. My results help explain catch variation among fishers, provide new tools with which researchers can evaluate the skipper effect, and are the basis for a theory of dynamics among marine habitat arrangement, resource distribution, and fishing strategies.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These data were contrasted against a long‐term series from a global database (Extended Reconstruction of Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST)) to evaluate whether these could substitute for FMT. The compatibility of species requirements with the thermal conditions was evaluated by comparing the temperature frequency distributions from the two FMTs, with the optimum and lethal temperature information available on five bivalve species of aquacultural interest. We concluded that there was no correlation between ERSST and FMT because the former underestimates the amplitude of real temperature fluctuations and exhibits a different pattern of variation during the year. Therefore, FMT was needed for a correct selection of an aquaculture site for bivalves. The FMT indicated high temperature variability at both sites studied on different time scales, with the site located at lower latitude (Rancho Bueno) warmer and with a higher variability than Laguna Manuela. Contrasting these results with optimum and lethal temperature values of bivalve species, it was possible to find the ideal site, for temperature, for culturing the species, taking into account the variability associated with large‐scale phenomena.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is different from El Niño events, whose frequency of occurrence is mostly centered in the 3‐yr period but with considerable dispersion. Possible causes for northward displacement of fauna include relaxation of the California Current, intensification of the countercurrent, and the formation and persistence of mesoscale eddies among others.

MPAs limit harvest to certain areas, but may enhance profits outside via spillover. TURFs incentivize local stewardship but may be plagued by spatial externalities when the TURF size is insufficient to capture all dispersal. Within a numerical model parameterized to a California marine species, we explore the economic and ecological effects of imposing MPAs on a TURF‐regulated fishery. Whether MPAs can enhance or diminish profits (or fish abundance) hinges critically on the level of coordination already occurring between TURF owners. If coordination is complete, private MPAs may already emerge in some TURFs; implementing additional MPAs reduces profits. However, to the extent that coordination is incomplete, strategically sited MPAs may be an effective complement to spatial property rights‐based fisheries, increasing both fishery profits and abundance.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides climate change associated with anthropogenic activity, there is growing evidence of a natural global multi-decadal climate signal in the ocean–atmosphere–biosphere climate system. The spatio-temporal evolution of this signal is thus analyzed during the 20th century and compared to the variability of small-pelagic fish landings. It is argued that the low-frequency global ocean environment and plankton ecosystems must be modified such that small-pelagic populations vary accordingly. A small-pelagic global index or fishing 'regime indicator series' (RIS) (i.e. a small-pelagic abundance indicator) is used. RIS is derived from fish landings data in the four main fishing areas in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Global RIS changes phase (from positive to negative values) when SST multi-decadal anomalies are out-of-phase between the eastern Pacific and southern Atlantic. RIS also displays maxima during the mid-30s to early-40s and the late-70s to early-80s when the multi-decadal signal was approximately changing phases (Tourre and White 2006 Geophys. Res. Lett. 33 L06716). It is recognized that other factors may modulate fish stocks, including anthropogenic predation. Nevertheless it is proposed that variable climate and environment, and the low-frequency 'global synchrony' of small-pelagic landings (Schwartzlose et al 1999 S. Afr. J. Mar. Sci. 21 289–347), could be associated with the multi-decadal changes in global ocean climate conditions.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used empirical orthogonal function analysis to extract the principal mode of the nonseasonal sea-surface temperature variability and compared it to the spatial signature of the Southern Oscillation Index. The first mode accounted for 80% of nonseasonal variability and its amplitude time series was significantly correlated to the Southern Oscillation Index (r = −0.58,P < 0.01). The amplitude of this mode and its statistical relation to the El Niño is stronger during winter, which suggests that forcing of sea-surface temperature variability occurs through the disruption of the wind-driven upwelling corridor along the eastern coast due to El Niño-related atmospheric teleconnections. We also examined weekly time series of coastal sea-surface temperature coastal anomalies along the coast of North America, including the interior of the Gulf of California, during the strong 1997–98 El Niño. We found a poleward propagating signal that reached the mouth of the Gulf of California at the end of spring and continued its poleward propagation along the west coast of the peninsula slightly delayed; it also resulted in warming inside the Gulf of California.

Our purpose is to explore the fine scale dynamics that emerge as aggregate social structure and dynamics. We use a biophysical model of the Maine lobster fishery to create a complex, dynamic environment. Agents compete by learning how to search for and harvest lobsters. We simulate individual learning with a modified version of John Holland's learning classifier system. At each iteration an agent must decide whether to continue fishing using already acquired knowledge about the resource or whether to acquire new knowledge by exploring on its own or by learning from another agent. Each agent's information about its environment has an opportunity cost that is created by limited time and by restricted (local) observation capabilities. Agents can communicate with and learn by imitating other agents but the cost of communicating with each other agent is an inverse function of the frequency with which the agents encounter one an-other. This 'familiarity' effect generates positive feedback and communication efficiencies that lead to the formation of persistent groups. The sharing of information within these groups gives agents the ability to avoid being trapped in local optima and increases both individual and collective efficiency. Agents develop search strategies that continuously switch between cooperative and autonomous search according to changing conditions of the resource and the costs of communication. We compare the aggregate outputs of the model with those observed in a large data set that tracks the time, location and catch of nearly a million lobster traps.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

grant.3050493,423704,Reduced wind speed improves plant growth in a desert city,2010,Bang et al. ,PloS One,1,3,3,40,9Apr20,"Background :The often dramatic effects of urbanization on community and ecosystem properties, such as primary productivity, abundances, and diversity are now well-established. In most cities local primary productivity increases and this extra energy flows upwards to alter diversity and relative abundances in higher trophic levels. The abiotic mechanisms thought to be responsible for increases in urban productivity are altered temperatures and light regimes, and increased nutrient and water inputs. However, another abiotic factor, wind speed, is also influenced by urbanization and well known for altering primary productivity in agricultural systems. Wind effects on primary productivity have heretofore not been studied in the context of urbanization.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We designed a field experiment to test if increased plant growth often observed in cities is explained by the sheltering effects of built structures. Wind speed was reduced by protecting Encelia farinosa (brittlebush) plants in urban, desert remnant and outlying desert localities via windbreaks while controlling for water availability and nutrient content. In all three habitats, we compared E. farinosa growth when protected by experimental windbreaks and in the open. E. farinosa plants protected against ambient wind in the desert and remnant areas grew faster in terms of biomass and height than exposed plants. As predicted, sheltered plants did not differ from unprotected plants in urban areas where wind speed is already reduced.
Conclusion/Significance: Our results indicate that reductions in wind speed due to built structures in cities contribute to increased plant productivity and thus also to changes in abundances and diversity of higher trophic levels. Our study emphasizes the need to incorporate wind speed in future urban ecological studies, as well as in planning for green space and sustainable cities.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Urbanization in the Phoenix, USA metropolitan region has dramatically altered regional ecosystem patterns, but little is known about how these changes have influenced soil organic matter, total nitrogen, and the distribution of nitrogen stable isotopes. Because urban development is a phenomenon occurring at multiple scales, ecological consequences of urbanization will likely differ between individual patches and the entire metropolitan region. To investigate such changes we conducted spatially explicit surveys including three dominant land‐use types in this region: native desert, agriculture, and mesic residential. These data were combined for analysis with previously collected samples from a synoptic regional survey. A landscape scaling approach was implemented to compare the dependence of soil variability on the sampled extent and the uncertainty associated with scaling from points to patches, land‐use types, and the Phoenix metropolitan region. The multiple‐scale analysis of soil properties showed that variation in total soil nitrogen, soil organic matter, and δ5N content of soils differed between patch and regional scales. The majority of variation in the urbanized patch types was exhibited between patches while for the native desert the majority of variation was observed within individual patches. These differences show the impact of urbanization on the scaling relations of ecosystem components. Overall, urbanization in this region appears to have increased soil organic matter by 44%, total nitrogen by 48%, and has elevated δ15N by 21%.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

grant.3050493,423704,Bivariate zero-inflated regression for count data: A Bayesian with application to plant counts,2010,Majumdar et al. ,International Journal of Biostatistics,3,3,3,15,9Apr20,"Lately, bivariate zero-inflated (BZI) regression models have been used in many instances in the medical sciences to model excess zeros. Examples include the BZI Poisson (BZIP), BZI negative binomial (BZINB) models, etc. Such formulations vary in the basic modeling aspect and use the EM algorithm (Dempster, Laird and Rubin, 1977) for parameter estimation. A different modeling formulation in the Bayesian context is given by Dagne (2004). We extend the modeling to a more general setting for multivariate ZIP models for count data with excess zeros as proposed by Li, Lu, Park, Kim, Brinkley and Peterson (1999), focusing on a particular bivariate regression formulation. For the basic formulation in the case of bivariate data, we assume that Xi are (latent) independent Poisson random variables with parameters ? i, i = 0, 1, 2. A bi-variate count vector (Y1, Y2) response follows a mixture of four distributions; p0 stands for the mixing probability of a point mass distribution at (0, 0); p1, the mixing probability that Y2 = 0, while Y1 = X0 + X1; p2, the mixing probability that Y1 = 0 while Y2 = X0 + X2; and finally (1 - p0 - p1 - p2), the mixing probability that Yi = Xi + X0, i = 1, 2. The choice of the parameters {pi, ? i, i = 0, 1, 2} ensures that the marginal distributions of Yi are zero inflated Poisson (? 0 + ? i). All the parameters thus introduced are allowed to depend on co-variates through canonical link generalized linear models (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989). This flexibility allows for a range of real-life applications, especially in the medical and biological fields, where the counts are bivariate in nature (with strong association between the processes) and where there are excess of zeros in one or both processes. Our contribution in this paper is to employ a fully Bayesian approach consolidating the work of Dagne (2004) and Li et al. (1999) generalizing the modeling and sampling-based methods described by Ghosh, Mukhopadhyay and Lu (2006) to estimate the parameters and obtain posterior credible intervals both in the case where co-variates are not available as well as in the case where they are. In this context, we provide explicit data augmentation techniques that lend themselves to easier implementation of the Gibbs sampler by giving rise to well-known and closed-form posterior distributions in the bivariate ZIP case. We then use simulations to explore the effectiveness of this estimation using the Bayesian BZIP procedure, comparing the performance to the Bayesian and classical ZIP approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the methodology based on bivariate plant count data with excess zeros that was collected on plots in the Phoenix metropolitan area and compare the results with independent ZIP regression models fitted to both processes.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus far, minimal research has been done on the degradation and fate of sucralose in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). We collected samples from WWTPs and surface waters in Arizona, United States. The average sucralose concentration of seven WWTP effluents was 2,800 ± 1,000 ng/L. Similarly, surface waters in Arizona contained sucralose at concentrations up to 300 ± 30 ng/L, which corroborates sucralose discharge from WWTPs into the environment. Biological degradation and chemical oxidation processes were evaluated to remove or transform sucralose under potential WWTP operation scenarios. Sucralose did not degrade in aerobic or anaerobic biological reactors, either metabolically or co-metabolically (in the presence of sucrose), after 42–62 days of experiments. Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation did not oxidize sucralose significantly, and chlorine and ozone addition led only to slow sucralose oxidation. Sucralose is not expected to degrade by free chlorine or ozone under typical WWTP operational conditions. Our results suggest that no significant sucralose degradation occurs in WWTPs, that it is present in their effluent waters, and that it reaches environmental water sources. We report for the first time the presence of sucralose in U.S. inland surface waters.

Generally, plant species richness often increases in cities due to importation of exotic species, whereas animal species richness declines. Abundances of some groups, especially birds and arthropods, often increase in urban areas despite declines in species richness. Although several models have been proposed for biodiversity change, the processes underlying the patterns of biodiversity in cities are poorly understood. We argue that humans directly control plants but relatively few animals and microbes— the remaining biological community is determined by this plant “template” upon which natural ecological and evolutionary processes act. As a result, conserving or reconstructing natural habitats defined by vegetation within urban areas is no guarantee that other components of the biological community will follow suit.

Rainfall variability for flash flood–producing storms in Dead Run can be quite large when viewed from a Euclidean perspective. When viewed from the perspective of a distance metric imposed by the drainage network of Dead Run, however, the spatial variability of rainfall is small. The drainage network structure diminishes the effects of spatial rainfall variability for storm event hydrologic response, resulting in Dead Run exhibiting striking uniformity of response to storms with contrasting spatial distribution of rainfall.

The purpose of this innovation was to promote the open sharing of data within and across organizational lines and across geographic distances. As the use of the system continued, end users and group administrators requested the development of a second, Intranet-based system with similar functionality. After three years of operation, a survey was conducted of users of the system to understand why some users and research groups appeared to utilize the two systems more than others. From this research we found that some barriers to use include: (1) mismatch of system functionality to user or group needs; (2) willingness to share with an internal group by Intranet but not with the world by Internet; and (3) resistance to entering metadata because of workplace habits. This experience has also taught us that with respect to web-based metadata and data repositories there is a difference between long-term and short-term research projects in their need to establish good metadata and data storage procedures. Moreover, some time is required for researchers to change from short-term to long-term project thinking. It is also important for organizations or managers of such research groups to reflect on established incentives and penalties that either encourage or discourage appropriate use of metadata in filing procedures. We conclude with a discussion of possible improvements that will be made to the system in the coming years, with an emphasis on the emerging phenomenon of “open content” (OC) collaboration that is being modeled after Internet-based collaboration in “open source” (OS) programming.

These costs and benefits, however, go well beyond those captured in conventional economic cost‐benefit analysis. It is not so much the mere consideration of costs and benefits that hampers cost‐benefit analysis but, rather, the narrowness and incompleteness of the subset of costs and benefits that are usually considered. To use cost‐benefit analysis for social decision making, one needs to think very broadly about which categories of costs and benefits need to be addressed (including effects on built, human, social, and natural capital as well as sustainable well‐being) and deal with the inherent uncertainty and imprecision attached to many of the more important categories. One needs to consider the full range of possible values and valuation methods, to shift the burden of proof to the parties that stand to gain from the decision, to deal with the distributional consequences of decisions, and to be clear about the social goals being served by the decision. Failure to think broadly enough about costs and benefits leads to decisions that serve only narrow special interests, not the sustainable well‐being of society as a whole.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the forested environment, the DEM resolution required is considerably lower and adequately supported by the photogrammetric data, and the relationship is strong under all moisture conditions. These results provide some insights into the length scales of near‐surface hydrological processes in the urbanizing environment, and the resolution of terrain data required to model those processes.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",Restoration Ecology ,2,2,3,105,21Apr20,"Hydrologic changes associated with urbanization often lead to lower water tables and drier, more aerobic soils in riparian zones. These changes reduce the potential for denitrification, an anaerobic microbial process that converts nitrate, a common water pollutant, into nitrogen gas. In addition to oxygen, denitrification is controlled by soil organic matter and nitrate. Geomorphic stream restorations are common in urban areas, but their effects on riparian soil conditions and denitrification have not been evaluated. We measured root biomass, soil organic matter, and denitrification potential (anaerobic slurry assay) at four depths in duplicate degraded, restored, and reference riparian zones in the Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A., metropolitan area. There were three main findings in this study. First, although reference sites were wet and had high soil organic matter, they had low levels of nitrate relative to degraded and restored sites and therefore there were few differences in denitrification potential among sites. Evaluations of riparian restorations that have nitrate removal by denitrification as a goal should consider the complex controls of this process and how they vary between sites. Second, all variables declined markedly with depth in the soil. Restorations that increase riparian water tables will thus foster interaction of groundwater nitrate with near‐surface soils with higher denitrification potential. Third, we observed strong positive relationships between root biomass and soil organic matter and between soil organic matter and denitrification potential, which suggest that establishment of deep‐rooted vegetation may be particularly important for increasing the depth of the active denitrification zone in restored riparian zones.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the United States, characterization of land use change following European settlement requires reconstruction of the original property mosaic. However, this task is difficult in unsystematically surveyed areas east of the Appalachian Mountains. The Gwynns Falls watershed (Baltimore, MD) was originally surveyed in the 1600–1700s under a system of warrants and patents (commonly known as ‘metes and bounds’). A method for the reconstruction and mapping of warrant and patent properties is presented and used to map the original property mosaic in the Gwynns Falls watershed. Using the mapped mosaic, the persistence of properties and property lines in the current Gwynns Falls landscape is considered. The results of this research indicate that as in agricultural areas, the original property lines in the Gwynns Falls watershed are persistent. At the same time, the results suggest that the property mosaic in heavily urbanized/suburbanized areas is generally ‘reset.’ Further, trends in surveying technique, parcel size, and settlement patterns cause property line density and property shape complexity to increase in the less urbanized upper watershed. The persistence of original patterns may be damping expression of heterogeneity gradients in this urban landscape. This spatial pattern of complexity in the original mosaic is directly opposite of hypothesized patterns of landscape heterogeneity arising from urbanization. The technique reported here and the resulting observations are important for landscape pattern studies in areas settled under unsystematic survey systems, especially the heavily urbanized areas of the eastern United States",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These geomorphic structures have the potential to support processes that produce or consume inorganic N (NH4+, NO3−) and thus affect streamwater quality. We measured production (potential net mineralization and nitrification) and consumption (denitrification potential, net immobilization) of inorganic N, respiration, and organic-matter content in sediments from geomorphic structures in 4 streams in and around Baltimore, Maryland, USA. We sampled sediments from stream pools, riffles, gravel bars (vegetated and nonvegetated), and organic debris dams in forested reference and suburban catchments, and also sampled degraded (incised channel) and restored reaches of one stream. Denitrification potential was highest in organic debris dams and organic-rich gravel bars—structures with high organic matter content. Organic debris dams in suburban streams had higher denitrification than debris dams in the forested reference stream, likely because of higher NO3− concentrations in suburban streams. These results suggest that denitrification in debris dams increases in response to high NO3− levels and that denitrification may be an important sink for NO3− in urban or suburban streams. However, such denitrifying structures as organic debris dams may be difficult to maintain in urban streams because of high storm flows and downstream displacement. Geomorphic structures in N-rich streams also supported higher rates of nitrification than structures in a forested reference stream, suggesting that these structures can become sources of NO3−. The ultimate effect of different structures on NO3− concentrations in urban streams will depend on the balance of these production and consumption processes, which is a complex function of a stream’s ability to retain organic matter and resist hydrologic changes associated with urbanization and elevated NO3− levels.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mean and median values of each variable measured across all plots showed that soil properties varied considerably. Chemical properties generally varied more than physical properties. A subset of the variables measured showed a pattern with land use and cover. Potassium, P, and bulk density were the most discerning variables differentiating forest cover from land uses dominated by turfgrass cover. Soil pH differentiated residential land use and cover from the other turfgrass types. This separation may reflect differences in management, e.g., additions of fertilizer, although additional research is needed to assess the importance of management on soil properties. Differences in surface soil properties among land use and cover types could be useful when conducting urban soil surveys, at least to spatially differentiate remnant soils from highly disturbed and managed soils. Other soil properties (Al, Mg, V, Ti, Mn, Fe, Ni, and soil texture) were related to surface geology and thus unique to the Baltimore region.

 from soils to nitrification and denitrification (Sutka et al., 2006). A
 critical aspect of the use of SP data to apportion sources of N2O to nitrification and denitrification is the need to evaluate data for isotope shifts that may have occurred during N2O reduction in soils prior to its escape to the atmosphere. We present data on the isotopologue effects during reduction of N2O during anaerobic incubation of soils and pure cultures of denitrifying bacteria. Isotopic enrichment factors for N2O
 reduction in soil mesocosms experiments varied between −9.2 and −1.8‰ 
for nitrogen and between −25.1 and −5.1‰ for oxygen. In pure cultures of
 Psuedomonas stutzeri and Psuedomonas denitrificans we observed isotopic enrichment factors for SP of −5.0 and −6.8‰, respectively. We further find that N2O consumption produces consistent relationships between δ18O and δ15N and δ18O and the δ15N of the central N atom in N2O
 of 2.5 and 1.6, respectively, which are clearly diagnostic of this 
process. Our results indicate that SP may be altered during reduction of
 N2O and thus bias evaluations of its origins. To understand the impacts of N2O reduction in soil flux studies on source isotope signals we modeled the isotope effects of N2O production occurring simultaneous with reduction and find increasingly curvilinear relationships between δ18O and δ15N and δ18O and δ15Nα with increased reduction. Consequently, a deviation from the linear mixing relationship between soil‐derived and atmospheric N2O is an indication of extensive reduction. On the basis of our characterization of isotopic fractionation during N2O
 reduction, we show that the rate of reduction would have to be 
substantially greater than 10% of that of production to impact SP 
estimates of N2O from denitrification by more than a few 
percent. Nonetheless, reduction results in a small, but potentially 
important, increase in SP away from values proposed for bacterial 
denitrification (0‰) toward those associated with production from 
nitrification (33‰) (Sutka et al., 2006). On this basis, estimates of 
the proportion of N2O derived from denitrification obtained from SP values are underestimates and therefore conservative.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we developed an economic model to examine farmers' production choices in a context where agricultural markets are linked to energy markets. We identified the economic conditions under which farmers could maximize their profits by converting current grain cropland to grow cellulosic biomass crops. An empirical illustration showed that with current technology, farmers are unlikely to grow switchgrass as a dedicated energy crop instead of corn on cropland. The biofuel incentives in the 2008 Farm Bill can improve the competitiveness of switchgrass, but may stimulate corn production as well, with corn residues as an alternative feedstock for advanced biofuels.

 traits affect soil processes may be particularly important in 
restorations that specifically select a target plant community. In this 
study, I examined how species differing in litter traits alter 
decomposition, both directly via chemistry and indirectly via influences

were compared with the native prairie grass, Andropogon gerardii,

negatively related to tissue chemistry, but showed little effect of 
microclimate differences. Soil bacterial community composition differed 
between species at one site, while extracellular enzyme activities 
differed between species at the other site. These findings suggest plant
 species may be altering microbial community function. Overall, litter 
chemistry was the dominant factor determining decomposition rates, 
suggesting that restoring native prairie grasses with recalcitrant 
litter into grass-dominated old-fields could slow litter decomposition

Increases in precipitation of 15–30% were detected during July from the easternmost part of the aquifer to as far downwind as Indiana. The timing (1940s, July) and spatial pattern of the precipitation increase are consistent with the history of Ogallala irrigation and mechanisms by which increases in evapotranspiration can affect convection. Additionally, we conducted a vapor tracking analysis and found that evapotranspiration over the Ogallala Aquifer contributes to downwind precipitation and that the contribution is greater when the evapotranspiration is higher. This makes it hydrologically possible that the irrigation development was associated with the observed precipitation increases. Finally, there is no clear evidence that atmospheric circulation changes or modes of internal climate variability increased the July precipitation.

At these locations, the role of the groundwater shifts from being primarily a sink to being primarily a source for the soil, as the season progresses from the wet spring to the dry autumn. Through the two‐way fluxes, groundwater exerts a certain degree of control on the root zone soil moisture fields; there is an apparent spatial correlation between the distribution of shallow water table and wet soil. Since the water table reflects long‐term climatic and topographic forcing and exhibits strong spatial organization, its link to the soil moisture gives the latter a certain degree of spatial organization as well.

In an earlier study we showed that a shallow water table can primarily exist in two types of hydrologic settings in North America: the humid river valleys and coastal regions in the east and the arid or semiarid intermountain valleys in the west. We also showed that the shallow water table in these settings can lead to significantly wetter soils than would exist without the presence of the water table. Here, we show that the water table–induced wetter soil directly maps into enhanced ET in the western setting, where soil water is a strong limiting factor of ET flux, but it is less likely to be the case in the more humid eastern setting where soil water is not limiting in general. We also ask whether any resulting enhanced ET will directly map into enhanced precipitation. Our hypothesis is that this can occur through two primary mechanisms: local, ET‐driven enhancement of convective precipitation and enhanced regional or lateral moisture convergence caused by altered soil moisture fields, and hence altered ET, far from the region of concern. We find that, indeed, water table–induced higher ET in the arid west results in greater convective precipitation and that ET‐precipitation coupling is primarily through local feedback pathways and precipitation recycling, with the main role of large‐scale moisture convergence as an initiator of convection following dry periods. Transitioning to the more humid regions farther east, the greater atmospheric (relative to surface) control of precipitation progressively obscures any potential effects of the water table, and the effects of large‐scale moisture convergence tend to dominate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparisons with VIC, the North America Regional Reanalysis (NARR), and observations suggest the following: first, SMC is wetter than VIC, despite their having identical land surface flux; second, while climate is the dominant signature in NARR and VIC, the water table manifests itself in SMC, with wet soil over the shallow water table; third, while soils in VIC and NARR get drier with depth, soils in SMC get wetter in regions of a shallow water table; and last, SMC has the highest root-zone (top 2 m) total soil water storage. These differences may have implications for climate modeling. We make our simulation results available to any interested researcher, for applications such as model initialization and intercomparison.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Streamflow, groundwater and precipitation time series spanning all or part of the period of intensive irrigation development (1940–1980) in the region were analyzed for trend and step changes using the non-parametric Mann–Kendall test and the parametric Student’s t-test, respectively. Based on several indicators to evaluate the streamflow–groundwater connection degree over the High Plains aquifer, we found a systematic decrease in the hydraulic connection between groundwater and streamflow from the Northern High Plains to Southern High Plains. Trends and step changes are consistent with this regional pattern. Decreasing trends in annual and dry-season (mean July–August) streamflow and increasing trends in the number of low-flow days are prevalent in the Northern High Plains with a gradual decrease in trend detection towards the south. Additionally, field significance of trends was assessed by the Regional Kendall’s S test over the period of most intensive irrigation development (1940–1980). The step-change results imply that the observed decreases in streamflow are likely attributable to the significant declines in groundwater levels and unlikely related to changes in precipitation because the majority of precipitation data over the region did not reveal any significant changes. Thus, it is very likely that extensive irrigational pumping have caused streamflow depletion, more severely, in the Northern High Plains, and to a lesser extent in the Southern High Plains over the period of study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When modeling a multi-scale system, a ‘top-down’ approach—basing models on emergent variables and interactions, rather than explicitly on the much faster and smaller scale processes that give rise to them—facilitates both goals. Parameterizations representing emergent interactions range from highly simplified and abstracted to more quantitatively accurate. Empirically based large-scale parameterizations lead more reliably to accurate large-scale behavior than do parameterizations of much smaller scale processes. Conversely, purposefully simplified representations of model interactions can enhance a model's utility for explanation, clarifying the key feedbacks leading to an enigmatic behavior. For such potential insights to be relevant, the interactions in the model need to correspond to those in the ‘real’ system in some straightforward way. Such a correspondence usually holds for models constructed for predictive purposes, although this is not a requirement. The goals motivating a modeling endeavor help determine the most appropriate modeling strategies, as well as the most appropriate criteria for judging model usefulness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The formation of these rhythmic features has been initially ascribed, depending on the pattern in question, to spatial structures in the flow or geological constrains. These forcing templates have been hypothesized to provide the spatial structure that becomes imprinted on the shoreline or seabed morphology. More recently, new explanations for rhythmic patterns have involved interactions between fluid flow and sediment transport that create morphological feedbacks and lead to pattern self-organization. While forcing-template models do not explicitly treat transport of the sediment that makes up the pattern, self-organization models focus on the strong couplings within flow/sediment systems, and on interactions between emergent structures. We illustrate the sweeping shift from template explanations to self-organization by discussing four nearshore patterns: beach cusps, surfzone crescentic sandbars, inner-shelf sorted bedforms, and large-scale cuspate shorelines. Models involving self-organization show that local interactions between flow and sediment transport can collectively give rise to patterns with large-scale coherence and that the driving feedbacks can be associated with either topographical or grain-size composition instabilities. An approach based on self-organization also allows researchers to establish limitations in the predictability of the occurrence of rhythmic patterns and characteristics as well as to study mechanisms leading to the observed variability of pattern or lack of regularity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These issues are most often investigated in a cross‐shore profile framework, fostering the implicit assumption that coastline responses will be approximately uniform in the alongshore direction. However, experiments with a recently developed numerical model of coastline change on a large spatial domain suggest that the shoreline responses to climate change could be highly variable. As storm and wave climates change, large‐scale coastline shapes are likely to shift—causing areas of greatly accelerated coastal erosion to alternate with areas of considerable shoreline accretion. On complex‐shaped coastlines, including cuspate‐cape and spit coastlines, the alongshore variation in shoreline retreat rates could be an order of magnitude higher than the baseline retreat rate expected from sea‐level rise alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survival of postfledging birds, other than American Robins, was high, and the effects of land cover on survival were limited. Across species, we observed lower survival in forested areas than in the suburban lands around them, but this may have been a function of fledgling age. Once juvenile birds became independent, they often moved into suburbs without increased risk of death. We found little consistency in relative habitat use within species, with the exception of American Robins, which used suburban residential areas more than forested areas.

Despite the dynamic nature of sandy barrier islands, economic incentive and recreational opportunities attract humans and development. Storm-driven sediment-transport events that build barrier islands constitute hazards to humans and infrastructure, and manipulations aimed at preventing or mitigating such events link human actions and long-term island morphodynamics. To explore how the behavior of a natural barrier island differs from one in which humans are dynamic system constituents, we use a numerical model of storm-driven sediment redistributions within the shoreface/island/back-barrier system and human rearrangements of sediment within the subaerial barrier island. In a modeled natural system, periods of dune growth and island stability, initiated by stochastic lulls in storm activity, alternate with stormy periods, in which shoreline erosion and frequent overwash regulate dune heights. When humans are included in the model, overwash deposits are removed from the island, and artificially high dunes are rebuilt. These manipulations tend to filter moderate overwash events. However, with shoreline erosion and rising sea level, these manipulations promote lower and narrower islands in the long term, so that when dunes are overtopped, the sediment redistributions are more severe. Thus, the coupled human/barrier system exhibits wider swings between increased island stability and sudden island displacements. Increasing the height of artificially maintained dunes increases the rate of island narrowing and, therefore, infrastructure relocation, and increases the need for sediment to be imported from outside the system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We develop an empirical study of the impact of urban development patterns on stream ecological conditions in 42 sub-basins in the Puget Sound lowland region on a gradient of urbanization.

Using community measures of benthic macroinvertebrates as indicators of in-stream biotic integrity we examined the relationships between urban development patterns and ecological conditions in these basins.

We used various measures of crow abundance and resource use to determine crows’ response to features of anthropogenic landscapes in the Puget Sound region of the United States. We examined land cover and land use composition at three spatial scales: study sites (up to 208 ha), crow home ranges within sites (18.1 ha), and local land cover (400 m2). At the study site and within-site scales crow abundance was strongly correlated with land cover providing anthropogenic resources. In particular, crows were associated with the amount of ‘maintained forest’ cover, and were more likely to use grass and shrub cover than forest or bare soil cover. Although crows did not show a generalized response to an edge variable, they exhibited greater use of patchy habitat created by human settlements than of native forests. Radio-tagged territorial adults used resources within their home ranges relatively evenly, suggesting resource selection had occurred at a larger spatial scale.

We find that the beach width coefficient is nearly five times larger than the OLS estimate, suggesting that beach width is a much larger portion of property value than previously thought.

Beach nourishment is the most prevalent means humans employ to alter the natural shoreline system in our case study, the Carolina coastline. Beach nourishment can cause shorelines adjacent to those that are nourished to shift both seaward and landward. When we further consider how changes to storm behaviors could change wave climates, the magnitude of morphological change induced by beach nourishment can rival that expected from sea level rise and affect the coast as far as tens of kilometers away from the nourishment site.

Rising sea level will enhance shoreline erosion, and recent work indicates changing storm patterns and associated changes in wave conditions can intensify coastal erosion along parts of a coastline. Investigations of coastal response to climate change typically consider natural processes in isolation neglecting repeated changes to the coastline from human actions, primarily through shoreline nourishment projects, which add sand to the shoreline to counteract erosion. In a model coupling economically driven shoreline nourishment with wave- and sea level rise-driven coastline change, and accounting for dwindling sediment resources for nourishment, coastline response depends dramatically on the relationship between patterns of property value and erosion. Simulations show that when nourishment costs rise with depletion of sand resources, coastline change is tied to the interaction between patterns of erosion and property value. Simulations show that when high property values align with highly erosive locations, sand resources are depleted rapidly and nourishment in lower property value towns is quickly abandoned. Although our model simulates a particular coastal morphology, the result that future behavior of the coastline and the economic viability of nourishment in a given town depend on the regional interaction between patterns of property value and erosion is likely applicable to many coastal configurations.

""Beach nourishment"", a common erosion-control practice, involves mechanically depositing sediment from outside the local littoral system onto an actively eroding shoreline to alter shoreline morphology. Natural sediment-transport processes quickly rework the newly engineered beach, causing further changes to the shoreline that in turn affect subsequent beach-nourishment decisions. To the limited extent that this landscape/economic coupling has been considered, evidence suggests that towns tend to employ spatially myopic economic strategies under which individual towns make isolated decisions that do not account for their neighbors. What happens when an optimization strategy that explicitly ignores spatial interactions is incorporated into a physical model that is spatially dynamic? The long-term attractor that develops for the coupled system (the state and behavior to which the system evolves over time) is unclear. We link an economic model, in which town-manager agents choose economically optimal beach-nourishment intervals according to past observations of their immediate shoreline, to a simplified coastal-dynamics model that includes alongshore sediment transport and background erosion (e.g. from sea-level rise). Simulations suggest that feedbacks between these human and natural coastal processes can generate emergent behaviors.

Helmers.","Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Environment",3,3,1,112,26Mar20,"Landscape-scale conversion of deeply rooted perennial native vegetation to annual crops has altered the ecohydrological balance in the Midwestern U.S. One of the major ways this may occur is through plant species’ abilities to access and take up water from different depths in the soil profile. In this study, we use stable isotope techniques to assess plant water uptake patterns for plants growing in four contrasting annual and perennial ecosystems in central Iowa: row-cropped cornfield, prairie, oak savanna, and woodland. To address limitations of conventional approaches to analyzing isotopic data, especially when isotopic profiles in the soil are complex, we employ an alternative ‘multiple source mass-balance isotopic’ approach suitable for determining probable contributions of multiple potential sources to total plant water uptake. Observed differences in isotopic profiles among the plant communities were attributed to differences in infiltration rates, plant water uptake rates, the degree of evaporative isotopic fractionation under the different vegetative covers, and processes of hydraulic redistribution. Savanna (Quercus macrocarpa Mixch) and woodland (Q. macrocarpa, Umus americana L.) trees had the lowest stem water δ18O values (−6.12‰, −7.77‰, and −7.61‰, respectively), whereas corn (Zea mays L.) and prairie (Andropogon gerardii) exhibited higher stem water δ18O values (−5.49‰ and −5.85‰, respectively), suggesting more shallow sources of water uptake for the latter. Frequency histographs produced from the multiple source mass-balance analysis confirmed that the corn and prairie species obtained up to 45% and 36% of their water from the upper 0–20 cm soil horizon, respectively. In contrast, oak trees growing in the savanna and woodland obtained up to 40% and 20% of their water from the upper 20 cm, and up to 60% and 80% of their water from depths >60 cm, respectively. Lack of strong isotopic gradients in the soil profiles combined with irregularities in the slope of the isotopic gradient by depth complicated interpretation of the data. However, an important advantage of the alternative multiple source mass-balance isotopic approach over conventional approaches was its capability of producing more quantitative and objective estimates for the probable contributions of multiple sources to total plant water uptake. This study highlights how changes in land use and vegetative cover in the Midwest affects plant water uptake patterns, and suggests how these changes may influence larger landscape scale alterations in the hydrologic balance.",actual title differs from the one listed on the grants page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Savanna remnants are frequently encroached by invasive trees to become woodlands. Thinning and prescribed burning can restore savanna structure, but the ecohydrological effects of managing these remnants are poorly understood. In this study, we measured sap flow (Js) to quantify transpiration in an Iowa bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) savanna woodland encroached by elms (Ulmus americana), and in an adjacent restored savanna after thinning to remove elms, during summer 2004. Savanna oaks had greater mean daily Js (35.9 L dm−2 day−1) than woodland oaks (20.7 L dm−2 day−1) and elms (12.4 L dm−2 day−1). The response of Js to vapor pressure deficit (D) was unexpectedly weak, although oaks in both stands showed negative correlation between daily Js and D for D > 0.4 kPa. An earlier daily peak in Js in the elm trees showed a possible advantage for water uptake. As anticipated, the woodland's stand transpiration was greater (1.23 mm day−1) than the savanna's (0.35 mm day−1), yet the savanna achieved 30% of the woodland's transpiration with only 11% of its sapwood area. The difference in transpiration influenced water table depths, which were 2 m in the savanna and 6.5 m in the woodland. Regionally, row-crop agriculture has increased groundwater recharge and raised water tables, providing surplus water that perhaps facilitated elm encroachment. This has implications for restoration of savanna remnants. If achieving a savanna ecohydrology is an aim of restoration, then restoration strategies may require buffers, or targeting of large or hydrologically isolated remnants.",actual title differs from the one listed on the grants page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested whether the Munroe Falls low-head dam, constructed in 1817 on the middle Cuyahoga River in the northeast Ohio portion of the Lake Erie watershed, formed a barrier for fish migration. Subsequent to our sampling, the dam was removed in fall 2005. The present study characterized the population genetic composition of two species of darters (Family Percidae), Etheostoma blennioides (greenside darter) and Percina caprodes (logperch darter), upstream and downstream from the dam in comparison with an outlying population from the Grand River, Ohio using mitochondrial DNA control region and cytochrome b gene sequences. Results found a single genotype in the greenside darter samples that was shared upstream and downstream from the dam, and thus no evidence for effect of the dam could be discerned. In contrast, samples of logperch darter differed in genotypic frequencies above and below the dam, with unique alleles occurring below the dam. It thus is possible that the Munroe Falls low-head dam acted as a one-way barrier to gene flow for logperch. Further genetic studies should test for possible after-effects of the dam removal on these darter populations, and relate these data to variation along and among river systems, including other potential barriers to gene flow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested the hypothesis that the top–down effects of P. cinereus are influenced by the species composition of invertebrates of the forest-floor. In a month-long microcosm experiment, we compared salamander effects on invertebrate species composition in leaf-litter from two sites that differed in species and size composition of invertebrate detritivores (an urban forest site at which isopods and millipedes were numerous and a rural forest site at which Collembola were the most numerous detritivores, but isopods and millipedes were few). Our results were consistent with our initial hypothesis. The presence of salamanders within microcosms was associated with decreased densities of oribatid mites, pseudoscorpions, isopods and millipedes in comparison to salamander-absent controls, but negative effects of salamanders on isopods and millipedes were most strongly expressed within urban litter microcosms. Salamanders were also associated with a positive, indirect effect, i.e., an increase in density of podomorphic Collembola in comparison to salamander-absent controls, but within urban litter exclusively. Our results suggested that plethodontid salamanders exerted positive, indirect effects through consumption of an intermediate predator, i.e., pseudoscorpions, and macroinvertebrate competitors, i.e., isopods and millipedes, of podomorphic Collembola.

S. Gulf Coast near New Orleans, Louisiana on Monday, August 29, 2005. The storm brought heavy winds and rain to the city, and several levees intended to protect New Orleans from the water of Lake Pontchartrain were breached. Consequently, up to 80% of the city was flooded with water reaching depths in excess of three meters in some locations. Research described in this paper was conducted to provide an initial assessment of contaminants present in floodwaters shortly after the storm and to characterize water pumped out of the city into Lake Pontchartrain once dewatering operations began several days after the storm. Data are presented which demonstrate that during the weeks following the storm, floodwater was brackish and well-buffered with very low concentrations of volatile and semivolatile organic pollutants. Dissolved oxygen was depleted in surface floodwater, averaging 1.6 mg/L in the Lakeview district and 4.8 mg/L in the Mid-City district. Dissolved oxygen was absent (<0.02 mg/L) at the bottom of the floodwater column in the Mid-City district 9 days after the storm. Chemical oxygen demand (Mid-City average = 79.9 mg/L) and fecal coliform bacteria (Mid-City average = 1.4 × 105 MPN/100 mL) were elevated in surface floodwater but typical of stormwater runoff in the region. Lead, arsenic, and in some cases, chromium, exceeded drinking water standards but with the exception of some elevated Pb concentrations generally were typical of stormwater.

Several chemical plants, petroleum refining facilities, and contaminated sites, including Superfund sites, were located in areas covered by floodwaters. Some 565 oil spills were noted in the wake of Katrina as a result of failures in the petroleum production and refining infrastructure. In addition, hundreds of commercial establishments such as service stations, pest control businesses, and dry cleaners use potentially hazardous chemicals that may have been released into the environment by the floodwaters. Adding to the potential sources of toxics and environmental contaminants are metal-contaminated soils typical of old urban areas and construction lumber preserved with creosote, pentachlorophenol, and arsenic. Compounding these concerns is the presence of hazardous chemicals commonly stored in households and the fuel and motor oil in approximately 400,000 flooded automobiles. Uncontrolled biological wastes from both human and animal sources also contributed to the pollutant burden in the city. Although the flooding in New Orleans resulted in the potential for unparalleled exposure to toxics and contaminants, initial concerns about a “toxic gumbo” have not been supported by sampling and analyses to date. Although floodwaters did contain significant short-term biological hazards that posed risks to stranded residents and relief workers, they did not contain chemical toxicants at levels that are expected to lead to long-term impacts on the surroundings, beyond the impacts expected of a similar volume of storm water from the city (Pardue et al. 2005).",no abstract - first paragraph used,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concern about a global decline in wild pollinators has increased interest in how pollinators are affected by human land use, and how this, in turn, affects crop pollination.

2. We measured wild bee visitation to four summer vegetable crops, and investigated associations between flower visitation rates and land‐use intensity at local and landscape scales. We studied 29 farms in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, USA. Over 2 years we recorded >7400 bee visits to crop flowers and identified 54 species of wild bees visiting crops.

3. Wild bees were the dominant flower visitors at three of the four crops studied; domesticated honeybees, Apis mellifera L., provided the remainder of visits.

4. Ordination of the two best studied crops showed that the wild bee species visiting tomato, Solanum lycopersicum L., were distinct from those visiting watermelon, Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai.

5. Crop visitation by wild bees was not associated with organic farming, nor with natural habitat cover at either local or landscape scale.

6. Synthesis and applications. The extent of crop visitation by wild bees observed in this study is among the highest recorded. In contrast to previous studies of crop visitation by wild bees, we did not find negative effects of conventional farming or natural habitat loss. In our study system, organic and conventional farms differ little in field size, crop diversity and weedy flower diversity, unlike some systems where organic farms have smaller fields with greater crop and weed diversity. Such variables may be more important than organic vs. conventional farming practices. Second, small patches of natural habitat are dispersed throughout our entire study system, and this habitat heterogeneity may support high bee abundance even in landscapes with a low proportion of natural habitat overall. Our findings suggest that agri‐environment schemes and similar programmes that work through local habitat restoration should target farms in intensively agricultural (homogeneous) landscapes to gain maximum conservation benefits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",Annals of Botany,1,1,1,292,16Apr2020,"Background and Aims
Crop pollination by bees and other animals is an essential ecosystem service. Ensuring the maintenance of the service requires a full understanding of the contributions of landscape elements to pollinator populations and crop pollination. Here, the first quantitative model that predicts pollinator abundance on a landscape is described and tested.

Methods
Using information on pollinator nesting resources, floral resources and foraging distances, the model predicts the relative abundance of pollinators within nesting habitats. From these nesting areas, it then predicts relative abundances of pollinators on the farms requiring pollination services. Model outputs are compared with data from coffee in Costa Rica, watermelon and sunflower in California and watermelon in New Jersey–Pennsylvania (NJPA).

Key Results
Results from Costa Rica and California, comparing field estimates of pollinator abundance, richness or services with model estimates, are encouraging, explaining up to 80 % of variance among farms. However, the model did not predict observed pollinator abundances on NJPA, so continued model improvement and testing are necessary. The inability of the model to predict pollinator abundances in the NJPA landscape may be due to not accounting for fine-scale floral and nesting resources within the landscapes surrounding farms, rather than the logic of our model.

Conclusions
The importance of fine-scale resources for pollinator service delivery was supported by sensitivity analyses indicating that the model's predictions depend largely on estimates of nesting and floral resources within crops. Despite the need for more research at the finer-scale, the approach fills an important gap by providing quantitative and mechanistic model from which to evaluate policy decisions and develop land-use plans that promote pollination conservation and service delivery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A test using crop pollination,2009,Winfree and Kremen,Proceedings of the Royal Society B - Biological Sciences,1,1,1,230,16Apr2020,"Biological diversity could enhance ecosystem service provision by increasing the mean level of services provided, and/or by providing more consistent (stable) services over space and time. Ecological theory predicts that when an ecosystem service is provided by many species, it will be stabilized against disturbance by a variety of ‘stabilizing mechanisms.’ However, few studies have investigated whether stabilizing mechanisms occur in real landscapes affected by human disturbance. We used two datasets on crop pollination by wild native bees to screen for and differentiate among three stabilizing mechanisms: density compensation (negative co-variance among species' abundances); response diversity (differential response to environmental variables among species); and cross-scale resilience (response to the same environmental variable at different scales by different species). In both datasets, we found response diversity and cross-scale resilience, but not density compensation. We conclude that stabilizing mechanisms may contribute to the stability of pollination services in our study areas, emphasizing the insurance value of seemingly ‘redundant’ species. Furthermore, the absence of density compensation that we found at the landscape scale contrasts with findings of previous small-scale experimental and modelling work, suggesting that we should not assume that density compensation will stabilize ecosystem services in real landscapes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Management of mobile organisms contributing to ecosystem services requires consideration not only of the local scale where services are delivered, but also the distribution of resources at the landscape scale, and the foraging ranges and dispersal movements of the mobile agents. We develop a conceptual model for exploring how one such mobile‐agent‐based ecosystem service (MABES), pollination, is affected by land‐use change, and then generalize the model to other MABES. The model includes interactions and feedbacks among policies affecting land use, market forces and the biology of the organisms involved. Animal‐mediated pollination contributes to the production of goods of value to humans such as crops; it also bolsters reproduction of wild plants on which other services or service‐providing organisms depend. About one‐third of crop production depends on animal pollinators, while 60–90% of plant species require an animal pollinator. The sensitivity of mobile organisms to ecological factors that operate across spatial scales makes the services provided by a given community of mobile agents highly contextual. Services vary, depending on the spatial and temporal distribution of resources surrounding the site, and on biotic interactions occurring locally, such as competition among pollinators for resources, and among plants for pollinators. The value of the resulting goods or services may feed back via market‐based forces to influence land‐use policies, which in turn influence land management practices that alter local habitat conditions and landscape structure. Developing conceptual models for MABES aids in identifying knowledge gaps, determining research priorities, and targeting interventions that can be applied in an adaptive management context.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used crop pollination as a model system, and investigated whether the loss of a domesticated pollinator (the honey bee) could be compensated for by native, wild bee species. We measured pollination provided to watermelon crops at 23 farms in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, USA, and used a simulation model to separate the pollen provided by honey bees and native bees. Simulation results predict that native bees alone provide sufficient pollination at > 90% of the farms studied. Furthermore, empirical total pollen deposition at flowers was strongly, significantly correlated with native bee visitation but not with honey bee visitation. The honey bee is currently undergoing extensive die‐offs because of Colony Collapse Disorder. We predict that in our region native bees will buffer potential declines in agricultural production because of honey bee losses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because native species pollinate many of these crops effectively, conserving habitats for wild pollinators within agricultural landscapes can help maintain pollination services. Using hierarchical Bayesian techniques, we synthesize the results of 23 studies – representing 16 crops on five continents – to estimate the general relationship between pollination services and distance from natural or semi‐natural habitats. We find strong exponential declines in both pollinator richness and native visitation rate. Visitation rate declines more steeply, dropping to half of its maximum at 0.6 km from natural habitat, compared to 1.5 km for richness. Evidence of general decline in fruit and seed set – variables that directly affect yields – is less clear. Visitation rate drops more steeply in tropical compared with temperate regions, and slightly more steeply for social compared with solitary bees. Tropical crops pollinated primarily by social bees may therefore be most susceptible to pollination failure from habitat loss. Quantifying these general relationships can help predict consequences of land use change on pollinator communities and crop productivity, and can inform landscape conservation efforts that balance the needs of native species and people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The low discharge in WY 1995 manifests negative anomalies in P ‐ E and precipitation, recycled summer precipitation, and dry surface conditions immediately prior to the water year.

The record high discharge in WY 1997 manifests the dual effects of reduced buffering by lakes and positive P ‐ E anomalies for most of the year. With reduced buffering, only modest P ‐ E the following spring led to a record discharge in May 1998.

The ratios increase with drainage area from the headwaters to downstream within the Lena basin. This pattern is different from the nonpermafrost watersheds, and it clearly reflects permafrost effect on regional hydrological regime. There is a significant positive relationship between the ratio and basin permafrost coverage. This relationship indicates that permafrost condition does not significantly affect streamflow regime over the low permafrost (less than 40%) regions, and it strongly affects discharge regime for regions with high permafrost (greater than 60%). Temperature and precipitation have similar patterns among the subbasins. Basin precipitation has little association with permafrost conditions and an indirect relation with river flow regimes. There exists a good relation between the freezing index and permafrost extent over the basin, indicating that cold climate leads to high coverage of permafrost. This relation relates basin thermal condition with permafrost distribution. The combination of the relations between temperature versus permafrost extent, and permafrost extent versus flow ratio links temperature, permafrost, and flow regime over the Lena basin. Over the Aldan subbasin, the maximum/minimum discharge ratios significantly decrease during 1942–1998 due to increase in base flow; this change is consistent in general with permafrost degradation over eastern Siberia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study addresses these issues by examining the relationship between residential site size and the distribution of agricultural land. The environmental setting of known agricultural sites in the region was used to develop a landscape scale model that identified areas of potential runoff agricultural land.

Existing analytical models are not well-suited for studying this harvest externality because they focus on species interactions across trophic levels instead of within them. We identify the conditions under which the harvesting of a single species causes at least one extinction of nonharvested species at the same trophic level. We compare two harvest regimes: uniform management, in which a privately optimal harvest rate is applied to the entire ecosystem; and specialized management, in which a portion of the ecosystem is intensively managed for the harvested species and the rest is left unharvested. Which regime is more likely to result in extinction depends on the discount rate and on the harvested species' competitive ability and colonization rate compared to those of the other species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",Environmental Resources Economics,1,1,1,17,15Apr20,"We examine the tradeoff between the number and average size of nature reserves. When the costs of enforcing reserve boundaries are negligible, we find analytically that the relative price of biodiversity has a positive impact on the optimal total reserved area but an ambiguous impact on the optimal number of reserves. Simulation modeling of floral diversity in a tropical timber concession reveals that the resolution of this ambiguity depends on spatial distributions of the populations of tree species: whether or not they are spatially aggregated (clumped). The impact of biodiversity price on optimal reserve number remains analytically ambiguous when enforcement costs are not negligible. Multiple reserves being economically superior to a single reserve now requires, in addition to aggregation, a biodiversity price that is sufficiently high to offset the effects of enforcement costs. Most of our simulation scenarios generate threshold biodiversity prices that do not exceed a leading estimate of the marginal value of a higher plant species in the bioprospecting literature. Several smaller reserves evidently can be economically superior to a single larger one even in the presence of enforcement costs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

McNamara",Geomorphology,1,1,1,146,22April2020,"A preliminary dynamical analysis of landscapes and humans as hierarchical complex systems suggests that strong coupling between the two that spreads to become regionally or globally pervasive should be focused at multi-year to decadal time scales. At these scales, landscape dynamics is dominated by water, sediment and biological routing mediated by fluvial, oceanic, atmospheric processes and human dynamics is dominated by simplifying, profit-maximizing market forces and political action based on projection of economic effect. Also at these scales, landscapes impact humans through patterns of natural disasters and trends such as sea level rise; humans impact landscapes by the effect of economic activity and changes meant to mitigate natural disasters and longer term trends. Based on this analysis, human-landscape coupled systems can be modeled using heterogeneous agents employing prediction models to determine actions to represent the nonlinear behavior of economic and political systems and rule-based routing algorithms to represent landscape processes. A cellular model for the development of New Orleans illustrates this approach, with routing algorithms for river and hurricane-storm surge determining flood extent, five markets (home, labor, hotel, tourism and port services) connecting seven types of economic agents (home buyers/laborers, home developers, hotel owners/ employers, hotel developers, tourists, port services developer and port services owners/employers), building of levees or a river spillway by political agents and damage to homes, hotels or port services within cells determined by the passage or depth of flood waters.

Werner.,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH - EARTH SURFACE,1,1,1,79,22April2020,"As humans increasingly occupy and modify marginal landscapes, previously unobserved long timescale, emergent behaviors related to interactions between natural processes and human agency are possible. Barrier islands, which are low‐lying strips of sand separated from a coast by lagoons, cut by inlets and topped by sand dunes, have been significantly modified through the development of tourist resorts. Resorts and barrier islands are dynamically coupled through storm damage and beach erosion, and measures taken to prevent or mitigate them. In response to rising sea level, a natural barrier island migrates steadily up the continental shelf. In contrast, we show that in a novel numerical model‐coupling barrier island processes with resort development, storm damage, and hazard mitigation, policy decisions driven by market dynamics destabilize barrier island response to rising sea level, giving rise to emergent, episodic boom and bust cycles, which alternate in phase alongshore, and less frequent, regionally extensive resort destruction events. Developed barrier islands are precariously maintained at lower elevations and further offshore than their natural counterparts, a situation exacerbated by insurance, which can lead to island inundation. Our results suggest that coastal areas that have recently instituted protection measures eventually will experience a widespread upsurge in damage if these practices are sustained, even in the absence of climate‐change‐induced increased storminess.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",Fisheries Oceanography,3,3,3,50,14Apr20,"Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, harvested in US waters are currently managed as a Gulf of Maine stock and as a stock comprising Georges Bank and southern New England populations. Over the past two and a half decades, success of age‐1 recruitment to the Gulf of Maine stock has varied by more than an order of magnitude. To investigate the hypothesis that this variation is related to variation in the transport of larval cod to nursery areas, we carried out model simulations of the movement of planktonic eggs and larvae spawned within the western Gulf of Maine during spring spawning events of 1995–2005. Results indicate that the retention of spring‐spawned cod, and their transport to areas suitable for early stage juvenile development, is strongly dependent on local wind conditions. Larval cod retention is favored during times of downwelling‐favorable winds and is least likely during times of upwelling‐favorable winds, during which buoyant eggs and early stage larvae tend to be advected offshore to the Western Maine Coastal Current and subsequently carried out of the Gulf of Maine. Model results also indicate that diel vertical migration of later stage larvae enhances the likelihood of retention within the western Gulf of Maine. Consistent with model results is a strong correlation between age‐1 recruitment success to the Gulf of Maine cod stock and the mean northward wind velocity measured in Massachusetts Bay during May. Based on these findings, we propose a wind index for strong recruitment success of age‐1 cod to the Gulf of Maine stock.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

grant.3077919,709518,The Impact of Whaling on the Ocean Carbon Cycle: Why Bigger Was Better,2010,Pershing et al. ,PLoS One,1,1,1,71,14Apr20,"Background: Humans have reduced the abundance of many large marine vertebrates, including whales, large fish, and
sharks, to only a small percentage of their pre-exploitation levels. Industrial fishing and whaling also tended to preferentially
harvest the largest species and largest individuals within a population. We consider the consequences of removing these
animals on the ocean’s ability to store carbon.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Because body size is critical to our arguments, our analysis focuses on populations of
baleen whales. Using reconstructions of pre-whaling and modern abundances, we consider the impact of whaling on the
amount of carbon stored in living whales and on the amount of carbon exported to the deep sea by sinking whale carcasses.
Populations of large baleen whales now store 9.16106 tons less carbon than before whaling. Some of the lost storage has
been offset by increases in smaller competitors; however, due to the relative metabolic efficiency of larger organisms, a shift
toward smaller animals could decrease the total community biomass by 30% or more. Because of their large size and few
predators, whales and other large marine vertebrates can efficiently export carbon from the surface waters to the deep sea. We
estimate that rebuilding whale populations would remove 1.66105 tons of carbon each year through sinking whale carcasses.
Conclusions/Significance: Even though fish and whales are only a small portion of the ocean’s overall biomass, fishing and
whaling have altered the ocean’s ability to store and sequester carbon. Although these changes are small relative to the
total ocean carbon sink, rebuilding populations of fish and whales would be comparable to other carbon management
schemes, including ocean iron fertilization.

The economic risk posed by this may be mitigated in some cases if individuals participate in several different fisheries, particularly if revenues from those fisheries are uncorrelated or vary asynchronously. We construct indices of gross income diversification from fisheries at the level of individual vessels and find that the income of the current fleet of vessels on the US West Coast and in Alaska is less diverse than at any point in the past 30 y. We also find a dome-shaped relationship between the variability of individuals' income and income diversification, which implies that a small amount of diversification does not reduce income risk but that higher levels of diversification can substantially reduce the variability of income from fishing. Moving from a single fishery strategy to a 50-25-25 split in revenues reduces the expected coefficient of variation of gross revenues between 24% and 65% for the vessels included in this study. The increasing access restrictions in many marine fisheries through license reductions and moratoriums have the potential to limit fishermen's ability to diversify their income risk across multiple fisheries. Catch share programs often result in consolidation initially and may reduce diversification. However, catch share programs also make it feasible for fishermen to build a portfolio of harvest privileges and potentially reduce their income risk. Therefore, catch share programs create both threats and opportunities for fishermen wishing to maintain diversified fishing strategies.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

However, no HCR is explicitly defined for the fishery of American lobster Homarus americanus in the Gulf of Maine (GOM), one of the most valuable commercial fisheries in the USA. In this study we evaluated five HCRs: the “linear” HCR, the “nonlinear middle convex” HCR, the “nonlinear convex” HCR, the “nonlinear concave” HCR, and the “catch” HCR. The first four HCRs use fishing mortality curves as boundaries that could adjust the next year's target fishing mortality linearly or nonlinearly based on the stock abundance, while the fifth HCR links the catch-based boundaries to the stock abundance. A sex-specific and size-dependent operating model was developed to simulate the GOM lobster fishery managed by the above five HCRs. Four performance measures were used to quantify the effectiveness of HCRs in the lobster fishery management. For each HCR we considered both short-term and long-term management time periods and scenarios of different recruitment dynamics and natural mortality rates, as well as uncertainties in key fishery parameters. This study shows that the linear HCR can effectively maintain the fishing mortality and stock abundance around the target levels. The nonlinear concave HCR could result in a higher lowest legal biomass and a higher terminal legal biomass in a short-term management period, especially when the abundance was low. Comparing the nonlinear middle convex HCR and the “nonlinear convex” HCR, when the abundance was high, an increase of the fishing mortality would not increase the total catch but would decrease the terminal legal biomass. The fishing mortality-based HCR was more effective than the catch-based HCR in managing the GOM American lobster fishery.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Meanwhile, the use of herring (Clupea harengus) as bait has increased fourfold since the 1970s, and is currently subsidising lobster productivity in mid‐coast Maine by augmenting the diet and growth of large juvenile and young adult lobsters before they recruit to the fishery. We investigated whether herring bait in the eastern portions of the Gulf of Maine is also subsidising these lobster populations. In 2004, we compared stomach contents, tissue production via stable isotope ratios, and growth rates of lobsters from seasonally open (Cutler, Maine, United States) and closed (Dipper Harbour, New Brunswick, Canada) fishing areas in the spring, summer, and autumn. Contrary to previous results in mid‐coast Maine, lobsters from seasonally closed sites at Dipper Harbour outgrew those from fished sites around Cutler. Yet examination of the diet of lobsters revealed several differences between open and closed sites that did not exist at sites in mid‐coast Maine. For instance, lobsters at Dipper Harbour consumed markedly more bivalves than those at Cutler. Furthermore, quantification of trap densities and the number of licensed fishers in mid‐coast versus eastern Maine determined that fishing effort was greatly reduced in eastern Maine. Thus, our results indicate thatherring bait subsidies are not important in eastern portions of the Gulf of Maine, but the availability of natural prey seemingly limits the growth of lobsters in eastern Maine. Moreover, our study suggests that bottom‐up forcing (i.e., food limitation) can have important consequences for lobster population dynamics and the productivity of lobster fisheries.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

This study suggests linear relationships between the fish abundances and the environmental variables. This linear relationship is more obvious if integrating fish species as a whole group than clustering them into subgroups.

Cod display strikingly variable colouration in the Gulf of Maine, with red- and olive-coloured cod found in close sympatry. Colour types from Cashes Ledge, a shallow, offshore (∼100 km) feature, are examined to see whether they differ in key life-history traits including diet, depth distribution, growth, and body morphology. Red cod consumed significantly more crabs, lobsters, and demersal fish, whereas olive cod consumed more shrimp. Stable carbon isotope signatures (δ13C) varied significantly among colour types, but are thought to reflect baseline differences in δ13C at Cashes Ledge (potentially useful for residence estimates). Red cod were confined to a small area of shallow water (<20 m) and were significantly smaller at age than olive cod. Body shape was used to classify colour types correctly with 84% accuracy; red cod had shorter snouts, deeper bodies, and more slender tails than olive cod. Collectively, the results suggest that red cod are resident at Cashes Ledge and represent a life-history strategy distinct from olive cod.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

The GOM lobster supports one of the most economically valuable commercial fisheries in the northeastern United States. The GOM ecosystem has experienced a great change over the last two decades, switching from a groundfish-dominated ecosystem to a lobster-dominated ecosystem. An evaluation of the GOM ecosystem dynamics can help identify possible causes of such a change and improve our understanding of interactions between lobster and other species in the same ecosystem. In this study, we developed a 24-group Ecosim model to quantify the ecosystem dynamics in the GOM from 1985 to 2007. We developed a Monte Carlo simulation approach to incorporate uncertainties for 15 most sensitive vulnerabilities. We found that the GOM ecosystem dynamics could be generally well simulated using the Ecosim model compiled in this study. A high fishing mortality in cod could result in high lobster stock biomass, suggesting that higher fishing pressure on cod in the 1980s might contribute to the high lobster biomass in recent years. A higher fishing mortality for lobster would have led to a lower lobster biomass. The change in the fishing mortality of cod and lobster would also affect the biomass dynamics of other functional groups, indicating that the Atlantic cod and American lobster fisheries played an important role in the change of the GOM ecosystem in the last two decades.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

We implemented a modeling approach for quantifying season-, size-, and sex-specific lobster spatial distribution in the Gulf of Maine with respect to environmental and spatial variables including bottom temperature, bottom salinity, latitude, longitude, depth, distance offshore, and 2 substratum features. Lobster distribution was strongly associated with temperature and depth, and differed seasonally by sex. In offshore waters in the fall, females were dominant at higher latitudes and males at lower latitudes. This segregation was not apparent in the spring although females were still dominant at higher latitudes in offshore waters. Juveniles and adults were also distributed differently; juveniles were more abundant at the lower latitudes in inshore waters, while adults were more widespread along the entire coast. These patterns are consistent with the ecology of the American lobster.

The spatial scale of this block suggests that variability in settlement is related to large‐scale, rather than local, processes. We examined the association between settlement at six reference regions and monthly mean atmospheric conditions (temperature, geopotential height, westerly and southerly wind components, and wind curl) from the North American Regional Reanalysis. We first extracted the dominant modes of variability in monthly averaged geopotential height, temperature, and wind curl. The leading mode from September, which represents high geopotential height, warm temperatures, and negative wind curl throughout the study area, was strongly correlated with settlement at most of the regions. The third mode from August, which represents enhanced southwesterly winds, was correlated with settlement in Rhode Island. Correlations between local atmospheric conditions and lobster settlement confirm the principal component results. Settlement was correlated to varying degrees with geopotential height (positive), temperature (positive) and wind curl (negative) with lobster settlement at the northern sites, with temperature being a stronger indicator in the north and curl a stronger indicator in the south. Rhode Island settlement was strongly correlated with August westerly winds. The correlation between settlement and atmospheric conditions could improve our understanding of stock‐recruit relationships for lobster populations and provides one mechanism for how climate change could impact lobsters.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

The watershed system is characterized by distributed decision processes at the agent level with a coordination mechanism organizing the interactions among individual decision processes at the system level. This paper presents a decentralized (distributed) optimization method known as constraint‐based reasoning, which allows individual agents in an MAS to optimize their behaviors over various alternatives. The method incorporates the optimization of all agents' objectives through an interaction scheme, in which the ith agent optimizes its objective with a selected priority for collaboration and forwards the solution and consequences to all agents that interact with it. Agents are allowed to determine how important their own objectives are in comparison with the constraints, using a local interest factor (βi). A large βi value indicates a selfish agent who puts high priority on its own benefit and ignores collaboration requirements. This bottom‐up problem‐solving approach mimics real‐world watershed management problems better than conventional “top‐down” optimization methods in which it is assumed that individual agents will completely comply with any recommendations that the coordinator makes.

Indirect human interferences, such as those resulting from land use and land cover changes, have been studied and modeled in many watersheds throughout the world. These kinds of human interferences usually have considerable impacts on the rising and falling limbs and the peak of a hydrograph. Direct human interferences, such as water withdrawals and return flows, can affect the base flow recession process, which is not greatly affected by the land surface condition. Direct human interferences are usually assumed to be known but are difficult to observe and model. The withdrawals and return flows are frequently added to or subtracted from estimates of naturally occurring streamflow, underlying an assumed linear relationship between streamflow and water withdrawal and return flow. This paper presents an empirical analysis to incorporate groundwater pumping and return flow as variables in the recession process. This technique is subsequently applied to the Salt Creek Watershed, a highly urban watershed located in the Chicago area. On the basis of the historical streamflow observation during 1946–2006, the analysis provides results that explain the impact of the aforementioned direct human activities on the base flow recession process. Moreover, this empirical method allows estimates of human water uses, such as groundwater pumping and return flow, to be made as long as a sufficiently long term streamflow data record is available. This analysis is verified with the data from the Salt Creek Watershed and can also be applied to other watersheds subject to intensive human interferences.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Making the best use of limited groundwater resources requires knowledge of its alternative extractive and non-extractive values, as well as the cost of extraction and the hydrological interlinkages between alternative uses. Groundwater value is driven by a number of factors including its supply and demand and institutional and policy factors. These factors and how they affect value of groundwater are described. Also described are the various components relevant to the economic valuation of groundwater and there is discussion on the potential difficulties in their practical estimation. It is argued that groundwater management is essential when there are large potential spatial and temporal externalities related to groundwater pumping. Maintaining non-extractive and option values is likely to require trade-offs with current extractive uses. Well-informed management will be required to allocate groundwater efficiently between different users such as agriculture, industry and the environment, while also balancing the needs of current and future generations.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we develop an economic model of groundwater management that explicitly incorporates spatial dynamic groundwater flow equations. Calibration of our model to published economic studies of specific aquifers demonstrates that existing studies generally incorrectly estimate the magnitude of the groundwater pumping externality relative to spatially explicit models. In particular, for large aquifers with surface areas of thousands of square miles, the marginal pumping externality predicted by single-cell models may be orders of magnitude less than that predicted by a spatially explicit model, even at large distances from a pumping well. Conversely, for small aquifers with areas of a few hundred square miles or less, single-cell models reasonably approximate the pumping externality. Application of single-cell models to inappropriate settings may result in misleading policy implications due to understatement of the magnitude and spatial nature of the groundwater externality.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigates interannual evapotranspiration (ET) variability and water‐energy balance at over 547 catchments across the contiguous United States in different climate zones. The investigation is based on ET data estimated from satellite images and surface daily meteorological data during the period of 1983–2006 provided by the University of Montana. We find that the interannual relationship between annual potential ET to annual precipitation (PET/P) and ET/P, the energy, and water factors defined with the Budyko curve framework can be captured by a linear function, with an average goodness of fit of 0.928 over all the catchments. The linear relationship is validated by another independent remote sensing ET product generated by the University of Washington and is demonstrated to be rational using regression diagnostics. Additionally, a comparison study using a water balance method and the Budyko curve is undertaken to examine the linear relationship. In addition to water supply and energy supply, the primary controls on evapotranspiration, soil water storage, response of vegetation to climate variability, and human interference are also major factors of the interannual relationship between PET/P and ET/P.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A theoretical analysis is performed in order to characterize the properties of an optimal emissions policy. The model is then applied in a numerical analysis of groundwater contamination by chloride from highway deicers, demonstrating the relevance of the theoretical results to practical management settings. This analytical approach can help determine which policy instruments are likely to be effective in controlling groundwater pollution, especially if costly numerical groundwater models are not available for the aquifer in question. Unlike previous economic studies of groundwater contamination, this approach defines optimal emissions policies as a function of geophysical parameters employed by hydrologists such as distance between source and sink, groundwater velocity, and aquifer dispersivity.

Four watersheds in the American Midwest are selected for the analysis, including two urban watersheds (Salt Creek and Des Plaines) and two agricultural watersheds (Embarras and Kankakee). The results show that the long‐term baseflow recession slope trends in all the watersheds are primarily induced by human interferences. In the urban watersheds, the recession slopes decrease over time in both winter and summer due to effluent discharges. In the Kankakee watershed with irrigation, the recession slopes decrease in winter but increase in summer, and the opposite winter and summer trends are caused by the seasonal water use regime of irrigated agriculture. In the Embarras watershed with rainfed agriculture, the recession slopes decrease over time in winter but display no change in summer. Sources of water withdrawal (groundwater versus surface water) also have different impacts on the recession process. This long‐term analysis of recession rates, in conjunction with the changes in low flow magnitude, offers valuable insight on human interferences to hydrologic processes.

Aufdenkampe, and J. Klaminder",,3,2,3,29,16Apr20,"In natural ecosystems, bioturbation is an essential component of soil formation, whereas tillage drives soil mixing in agricultural soils. Yet soil mixing is commonly neglected in modeling soil organic carbon (SOC) as it responds to land use changes. Here, in order to determine mixing‐driven carbon fluxes, we combine a mass balance model with measurements of 210Pb activities and SOC contents. Soil mixing rates by tillage decrease from 3.4 ± 2.3 cm yr−1 at the surface to 0.8 ± 0.2 cm yr−1 at a depth of ∼20 cm, causing the SOC stored in the upper 25 cm of the soil to be physically turned over via mixing annually. In contrast, the bioturbation‐driven soil mixing velocity at the forest increases from 0.6 ± 0.1 cm yr−1 at the surface to 2.7 ± 0.5 cm yr−1 at a depth of ∼10 cm, which results in physically turning over SOC in the A horizon via mixing on years to decadal time scales. Therefore, SOC fractions with different susceptibilities to decomposition may have significantly different physical trajectories within the soils over their lifespans, and thus the assumption of C‐cycling models that all SOC fractions experience identical environmental conditions is unlikely to be realistic. Carbon sinks, excesses of plant carbon inputs over decomposition carbon losses, are found within the top portion of the A horizons. These carbon excesses are transferred, via mixing, to the lower portion of the A horizon, where they are decomposed. By quantifying mixing‐derived SOC fluxes, this study shows a previously unrecognized complexity in understanding SOC dynamics associated with land use changes.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kaplan.",Limnology and Oceanography-Methods,3,3,3,24,16Apr20,"Integrated carbon budgets of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems indicate that particulate organic carbon (POC) plays an important role in the transport, storage, and turnover of carbon during its transit from land to sea. However, little is known about the rates at which POC in suspension is metabolized during downstream transport. We address this deficiency by improving existing respiration methods and models to assess the biological lability of POC suspended in a headwater stream. Our method involves concentration of stream particles by tangential flow filtration, extended incubations (35‐40 d) using conditions to ensure particle suspension and prevent particle aggregation, correction for the simultaneous respiration of dissolved organic carbon, and conversion from oxygen measurements into carbon with a respiratory oxidation ratio (OR) of 1.30 O2:C. We include analysis of the choice of OR. The POC turnover times estimated with the improved methods in this study are ~10 days. These respiration rates are among the highest reported for either suspended or benthic POC in streams and suggest that suspended POC is mineralized closer to its point of origin than was previously assumed. During incubation, keeping POC in suspension can increase respiration rates as much as 2‐fold compared with allowing particles to settle and physical inhibition of POC aggregation can increase rates by 1.2‐fold compared with allowing POC to aggregate. Methods that explicitly incorporate suspension and discourage aggregation of POC and longer incubation times during respiration measurements will generate data that improve our understanding of the dynamic role of POC in aquatic ecosystems.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To guide remediation, an analytical model is developed to predict the mercury inventory resulting from deposition of mercury‐contaminated sediment on subhorizontal surfaces adjacent to the river channel from 1930 to 2007. Sediment cores and geomorphic data were obtained from 27 sites. Mercury inventories range from 0.00019 to 0.573 kg m−2. High mercury inventories are associated with frequent inundation by floodwaters, forested riparian vegetation, and (at only four sites) unusually high sediment accumulation. Over the 10 km study reach, mercury inventories do not vary with downstream distance. The frequency of inundation at each coring site is determined from hydrologic data and a streamtube stage‐discharge model. Water levels are exponentially distributed. A simple parameterization represents the enhanced ability of forested vegetation to trap mercury‐contaminated sediments compared to nonforest vegetation. The calibrated model explains 62% of the observed variation in mercury inventories; 15 of the 27 predicted values are within a factor of 1.8 of the observed values. Calibration indicates a mercury deposition rate during inundation of 0.040 kg m−2 yr−1 (95% C.I. 0.032–0.048), that forested areas accumulate mercury‐contaminated sediment 3.05 (95% C.I. 2.43–3.67) times faster than nonforested areas, and that floodwaters deeper than 0.98 (95% C.I. 0.45–1.53) m do not accumulate suspended sediment or mercury. At four sites, floodplain accumulation of 0.8–1.2 m occurred over a period of 39 (95% C.I. 22–56) years, while sedimentation is negligible (mean: 0.1 m, median: 0.03 m) at other sites.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Newbold.",Journal of Theoretical Biology,3,3,3,8,16Apr20,"Most ecological studies of particle transport in streams that focus on fine particulate organic matter or benthic invertebrates use the Exponential Settling Model (ESM) to characterize the longitudinal pattern of particle settling on the bed. The ESM predicts that if particles are released into a stream, the proportion that have not yet settled will decline exponentially with transport time or distance and will be independent of the release elevation above the bed. To date, no credible basis in fluid mechanics has been established for this model, nor has it been rigorously tested against more-mechanistic alternative models. One alternative is the Local Exchange Model (LEM), which is a stochastic advection–diffusion model that includes both longitudinal and vertical spatial dimensions and is based on classical fluid mechanics. The LEM predicts that particle settling will be non-exponential in the near field but will become exponential in the far field, providing a new theoretical justification for far-field exponential settling that is based on plausible fluid mechanics. We review properties of the ESM and LEM and compare these with available empirical evidence. Most evidence supports the prediction of both models that settling will be exponential in the far field but contradicts the ESM's prediction that a single exponential distribution will hold for all transport times and distances.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plug‐flow bioreactors, colonized and maintained with natural stream water, were used to determine the concentrations of stream‐water biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) and relative concentrations of FDOM within operationally defined biodegradability classes. Labile molecules with turnover times of hours are metabolized within the stream reach where they originated; semi‐labile molecules with turnover times of days travel out of the reach and are transported downstream before being metabolized; and a more recalcitrant class with a longer but undetermined turnover time flows through the river network without being metabolized. Between 26% and 31% of the DOC was biodegradable, with 8.6% labile and the balance semi‐labile. Humic‐like FDOM was a proxy for more recalcitrant DOM, exhibiting a ± 2% change as a function of increased bioreactor residence time. Humic‐like FDOM represents only the more recalcitrant and perhaps the more hydrophobic constituents and not the ecologically important semi‐labile humic substances within the BDOC pool. Tyrosine‐like and tryptophan‐like FDOM constituents included not only labile DOM, but also semi‐labile, and more recalcitrant moieties. For example, 13% of the tryptophan‐like FDOM was labile, 14% was semi‐labile, and 73% was more recalcitrant, while tyrosine‐like FDOM was 100% biodegraded and the majority (44–69%) was classified as labile.

The RFBS, established in 1992 in a 15‐ha agricultural (row crop) watershed, consists of: Zone 1, a streamside strip (∼10 m wide) of permanent woody vegetation for stream habitat protection; Zone 2, an 18‐ to 20‐m‐wide strip reforested in hardwoods upslope from Zone 2; and Zone 3, a 6‐ to 10‐m‐wide grass filter strip in which a level lip spreader was constructed. The monitoring design used paired watersheds supplemented by mass balance estimates of nutrient and sediment removal within the treated watershed. Tree growth was initially delayed by drought and deer damage, but increased after more aggressive deer protection (1.5 m polypropylene shelters or wire mesh protectors) was instituted. Basal tree area increased ∼20‐fold between 1998 and 2006, and canopy cover reached 59% in 2006. For streamwater nitrate, the paired watershed comparison was complicated by variations in both the reference stream concentrations and in upslope groundwater nitrate concentrations, but did show that streamwater nitrate concentrations in the RFBS watershed declined relative to the reference stream from 2002 through the end of the study in early 2007. A subsurface nitrate budget yielded an average nitrate removal by the RFBS of 90 kg/ha/year, or 26% of upslope subsurface inputs, for the years 1997 through 2006. There was no evidence from the paired watershed comparison that the RFBS affected streamwater phosphorus concentration. However, groundwater phosphorus did decline within the buffer. Overland flow sampling of 23 storms between 1997 and 2006 showed that total suspended solids concentration in water exiting the RFBS to the stream was on average 43% lower than in water entering the RFBS from the tilled field.

In eastern North American forests, geographic broods of periodical cicadas emerge every 13 to 17 y to breed, and local abundances can sometimes be >300 individuals/m2. Most individuals avoid predation, senesce after breeding, and become a resource pulse for forest ecosystems; some cicada carcasses enter freshwater ecosystems where they represent a detrital resource pulse. Here, we present a 2-part study in which we examined the deposition of cicada detritus into woodland ponds and low-order streams in southwestern Ohio during the emergence of Brood X periodical cicadas. We compared the deposition of nutrients associated with periodical cicada detritus and terrestrial leaf litter into small woodland ponds and low-order streams. We used a laboratory experiment to compare patterns of decomposition and nutrient release of adult periodical cicada carcasses and sycamore leaf litter. Input of periodical cicada detritus to woodland streams and ponds was a function of local cicada emergence densities. Organic C loading to woodland aquatic ecosystems from cicada detritus was substantially less than that from terrestrial leaf litter; however, the higher mass-specific N and P content of cicada material made cicada detritus a relatively important nutrient input. N and P deposited in cicada detritus represented 0.2 to 61% of the N and 0.3 to 50% of the P deposited into woodland aquatic ecosystems via terrestrial leaf litter. Decomposition experiments indicated that cicada detritus was of much higher quality than was sycamore leaf litter; female and male cicada carcasses lost mass at significantly faster rates than sycamore leaves (female k = −0.05/d, male k = −0.04/d, sycamore leaf k = −0.002/d). Release rates of C, N, and P from cicada carcasses were 4, 39, and 150× greater, respectively, than release rates from sycamore leaves. Our study indicates that periodical cicada detritus can represent a substantial allochthonous resource pulse to forested aquatic ecosystems and that cicada detritus is of substantially higher quality than is terrestrial leaf litter. These results suggest that deposition and decomposition of periodical cicada detritus can affect the productivity and dynamics of woodland aquatic ecosystems and that the role of animal-derived resource pulses to ecosystems requires further exploration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among other sensory modalities, the wolf spider, Pardosa milvina (Araneae, Lycosidae), uses a variety of chemical and visual information in reproductive activities. Here we report the results of four laboratory experiments in which we explored the effects of visual and chemical information on the behaviour of males. First we established that chemical cues enabled males to find females and that visual cues kept the males' attention focused in the area of the females. Subsequently, we examined the separate and combined effects of visual and chemical cues on the interactions between males competing for virgin or mated females. The behaviour of interacting males revealed that either chemical or visual information was sufficient for them to discriminate between mated and virgin females. Chemical cues elicited more courtship activity and more intense aggressive interactions between males than visual cues. When males were able to see live mated females but were in contact with chemical cues from virgins, aggression was lower and, conversely, when males were able to see live virgin females but were in contact with chemical cues from mated females, aggression increased. We conclude that chemical cues provided males with the most critical discriminatory information. Although the two types of signals are largely redundant, there are some circumstances where they enhance the response of the males and there is an intersignal interaction that allows males to adjust their behaviour when presented with a receptive female.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined if caged, uncaged or no green frogs affected survival, growth and hiding behavior of recently metamorphosed American toads in a replicated laboratory experiment. Green frogs did not appear to prey upon small American toads. However, by the end of the experiment American toad survival was lowest in treatments with uncaged green frogs; this result suggests that green frogs may outcompete American toads for food, but such impacts in nature may be limited or may have selected for spatial segregation in the terrestrial environment. Green frogs also increased hiding activity of toads at sonic times, which may in part explain the trend of reduced mass gained when toads were reared with green frogs.

The response of mass at metamorphosis and time to metamorphosis was significantly affected by exposure to malathion and presence of overwintered green frog tadpoles. Malathion generally led to increased mass at metamorphosis, earlier time to metamorphosis, and increased activity during larval development. These results likely stem from short-term increases in periphyton associated with malathion exposure (although these effects were nonsignificant). Exposure of gray treefrogs to overwintered green frog tadpoles led to an earlier time to metamorphosis without differences in mass at metamorphosis and was associated with increased activity in gray treefrogs. Survival of gray treefrogs was significantly affected by an interaction of green frog and malathion, indicating nonadditive effects of these treatments.

Although glyphosate-based herbicides are not acutely toxic to arthropods, little is known regarding their effects on natural chemical communication pathways. The wolf spider, Pardosamilvina, is abundant in agroecosystems where herbicides are regularly applied and uses air- and substrate-borne chemical signals extensively during mating. The aim of this study was to examine effects of a commercial formulation of a glyphosate-based herbicide on the ability of males to find females. In the field, virgin females, when hidden inside pitfall traps with herbicide, attracted fewer males than females with water. Likewise females in traps with a ring of herbicide surrounding the opening were less likely to attract males than those in traps surrounded by water. We explored the reaction of males to any airborne component of the herbicide in a laboratory two-choice olfactometer experiment. When no female pheromones were present, males were equally likely to select herbicide or water treated corridors and they all moved through the apparatus at similar speeds. When female pheromones were present, the males that selected control corridors moved more slowly than those that selected herbicide and, if we control for the initial decision time, more males selected the control corridors over the herbicide. These data suggest that glyphosate-based herbicides are ""info-disruptors"" that alter the ability of males to detect and/or react fully to female signals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite evidence that the qualitative characteristics (subunit type, polymer chain length) of these complex polyphenolics are important determinants of biological activity, little is known about genetic and environmental controls on the type of proanthocyanidins produced by plants. We tested the hypothesis that genetics, season, developmental stage, and environment determine proanthocyanidin qualitative characteristics by using four Populus ""cross types"" (narrowleaf [P. angustifolia], Fremont [P. fremontii], F1 hybrids, and backcrosses to narrowleaf). We used thiolysis and HPLC analysis to characterize the proanthocyanidins, and found that genetics strongly control composition. The narrowleaf plants accumulate mixed procyanidin/prodelphinidins with average composition epicatechin(11)-epigallocatechin(8)-catechin(2)-catechin((terminal)). Backcross genotypes produce mixed procyanidin/prodelphinidins similar to narrowleaf, while Fremont makes procyanidin dimers, and the F1 plants contain procyanidin heptamers. Less striking effects were noted for genotype × environment, while season and developmental zone had little effect on proanthocyanidin composition or chain length.

In a previous laboratory study, female prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) showed significant social and sexual preferences for males with longer microsatellite DNA within the avpr1a gene encoding the vasopressin 1a receptor, as predicted if females select mates whose parental behaviour should increase female reproductive success. We tested the hypothesis that males with short versus long avpr1a microsatellite alleles exhibit differences in courtship behaviour, which could act as cues for female mate preference. The only behavioural difference we detected between males with short versus long avpr1a microsatellite alleles in mate preference trials was that males with short avpr1a microsatellite alleles sniffed the anogenital region of females more frequently during the first two days of the trials. Our results did not strongly support the hypothesis that a male's avpr1a genotype predicts the courtship behaviours we measured and suggests that other courtship behaviours or traits, such as odour and vocalizations, may be more important to female prairie voles when choosing mates. Additional studies using a wider array of species are needed to assess the degree to which male mammal courtship behaviour provides information on mate quality to females.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Underlying and intertwining themes in these frameworks are the services of (a) moving seeds away from parent plants, (b) placing seeds in safe and ideal locations and occasionally, (c) removing elaiosomes to thwart detection by seed predators. These services are rarely simultaneously investigated from an experimental standpoint to determine which may be most important. Here, we conducted a factorial-designed field experiment to test how survival of seeds of a myrmecochrous forest herb, Asarum canadense (wild ginger), in two forest sites in southwestern Ohio, USA, was affected by the following treatments: distance from parent plant, seed burial, elaiosome removal, and their interactions. We found that when placed in artificial depots consisting of 10 seeds, only seed burial significantly aided seed survival. We supplemented this by conducting a laboratory experiment in which mice were given choices of trays containing either buried seeds with elaiosomes or without elaiosomes at densities higher than those of our field experiment and within the realm of those contained in ant nests. Mice consumed more mass of seeds with elaiosomes, suggesting that elaiosome removal may be advantageous in this context. When taken together, our results highlight the importance of seed burial and elaiosome removal for seed survival of a myrmecochorous forest herb. Though not specifically addressed in our study, the combination of these two services may positively contribute to later life history stages (e.g., seedlings) and population persistence of myrmecochorous plants and may ultimately reveal the importance of other services (e.g., short-distance seed dispersal) and their interactions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",Earth System Dynamics ,1,1,1,74,16Apr20,"A primary goal of Earth system modelling is to improve understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between human decision making and biophysical processes. The nexus of land use and land cover change (LULCC) and the climate system is an important example. LULCC contributes to global and regional climate change, while climate affects the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems and LULCC. However, at present, LULCC is poorly represented in Global Circulation Models (GCMs). LULCC models that are explicit about human behaviour and decision making processes have been developed at local to regional scales, but the principles of these approaches have not yet been applied to the global scale level in ways that deal adequately with both direct and indirect feedbacks from the climate system. In this article, we explore current knowledge about LULCC modelling and the interactions between LULCC, GCMs and Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs). In doing so, we propose new ways forward for improving LULCC representations in Earth System Models. We conclude that LULCC models need to better conceptualise the alternatives for up-scaling from the local to global. This involves better representation of human agency, including processes such as learning, adaptation and agent evolution, formalising the role and emergence of governance structures, institutional arrangements and policy as endogenous processes and better theorising about the role of tele-connections and connectivity across global networks. Our analysis underlines the importance of observational data in global scale assessments and the need for coordination in synthesising and assimilating available data","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Its use is partially driven by increasing demand from decision makers to provide support for understanding the potential implications of decisions in complex situations. While one of the advantages of agent-based modelling is the ability to simulate the implications of human decision-making processes explicitly, methods for providing empirical support for the representation of the behaviour of human agents have not been structured systematically. This paper develops a framework for the parameterisation of human behaviour in agent-based models and develops twelve distinct sequences for the characterisation and parameterisation of human behaviours. Examples are provided to illustrate the most important sequences. This framework is a first step towards a guide for parameterisation of human behaviour in ABM.

Furthermore, with the increasing availability of longitudinal land-change data, evidence is needed on the relative performance of these two different methods in situations with differing levels of data abundance. To fill this gap, we generated a pseudo land-change data set using an agent-based model of residential development in a virtual landscape. This agent-based model simulated the decisions of homebuyers in choosing residential locations based on the values of several spatial variables. Pseudo land-change maps, generated by the agent-based model with different weights on these spatial variables, were exposed to statistical analysis under the logistic and survival approaches. We evaluated how well the two approaches could reveal the spatial variables that were used in the agent-based model and compared the performance of the two methods when land-change data were collected under different sampling frequencies. Our results suggest that survival analysis outperforms logistic regression in detecting the variables that were included in agent decisions, largely because it takes into account time-dependent variables. Also, this research suggests that various properties of land-change processes (like amount of developed area and access of agents to information) affect the relative performance of these statistical approaches aimed at uncovering land-change predictor variables.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Landscape ecology as described by Wu (Landscape Ecol 28:1–11, 2013) therefore needs three additional topics of investigation: (1) the local landscape as a boundary object that builds communication among disciplines and between science and local communities, (2) iterative and collaborative methods for generating transdisciplinary approaches to sustainable change, and (3) the effect of scientific knowledge and tools on local landscape policy and landscape change.

Human settlement growth was measured by changes in the density of housing units. Vegetation carbon uptake was estimated with gross primary production (GPP) based on the light-use efficiency approach applied to satellite imagery. Annual GPP was found to increase by approximately 140 g C m−2 on average for the entire study area in 2001 compared to 1992/1993, accompanied by region-wide increases in downward shortwave radiation and minimum daily temperature. Changes in GPP, however, varied significantly by different types of settlement growth. Exurbanized areas, where the rural settlement (less than 0.025 units per acre) converted to exurbs (0.025–0.6 units per acre), were associated with approximately 157 g C m−2 increase in GPP due to high vegetation proportions. Suburbanization, the conversion from exurban settlement to suburbs (0.6–4 units per acre), was related with a decline of GPP by 152 g C m−2 due to progressive development of built-up land cover. Results help to understand the potential of carbon mitigation in the human-dominated landscapes using vegetation as a natural store of carbon dioxide. This in turn has implications for the low-carbon development planning along the gradient of human settlement densities.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Although market activities are at the core of economic studies of land-use change, many market elements are neglected by coupled human–environment models. We scrutinized the effects of the level of detail of market representation using an abstract, agent-based model of land-use change. This model includes agents representing land buyers and sellers and their respective market-based decision-making behaviors. Our results show that although incorporating key market elements, particularly budget constraints and competitive bidding, in land-use models generally alters projected land-use patterns, their impacts differ significantly depending on the level of detail of market representation. Consistent with theories of land change, our research confirms that budget constraints can considerably reduce the projected quantity of land-use change. The effects of competitive bidding, however, are more complex and depend on buyers’ budgets, their relative preferences for proximity versus open-space amenities, and the size of neighborhoods. Market competition might reduce or increase the quantity of land-use change and the degree of sprawl in the simulated landscapes. Because of the strong effects of market elements on resulting patterns, adequate representation of the structure of markets is important for capturing and characterizing the complexity inherent in coupled human–environment systems.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

However, the relationship between heterogeneous economic agents and the resultant landscape patterns and socioeconomic dynamics has not been systematically explored. In this paper, we present a stylized agent-based land market model, Land Use in eXurban Environments (LUXE), to study the effects of multidimensional agents’ heterogeneity on the spatial and socioeconomic patterns of urban land use change under various market representations. We examined two sources of agent heterogeneity: budget heterogeneity, which imposes constraints on the affordability of land, and preference heterogeneity, which determines location choice. The effects of the two dimensions of agents’ heterogeneity are systematically explored across different market representations by three experiments. Agents’ heterogeneity exhibits a complex interplay with various forms of market institutions as indicated by macro-measures (landscape metrics, segregation index, and socioeconomic metrics). In general, budget heterogeneity has pronounced effect on socioeconomic results, while preference heterogeneity is highly pertinent to spatial outcomes. The relationship between agent heterogeneity and macro-measures becomes more complex when more land market mechanisms are represented. In other words, appropriately simulating agent heterogeneity plays an important role in guaranteeing the fidelity of replicating empirical land use change process.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

The framework provides an overarching design that can be extended into specific model implementations to evaluate how policy, land-management preferences, and land-market dynamics affect (and are affected by) land-use and land-cover change patterns and subsequent carbon storage and flux. To demonstrate the framework, we implement a simple integration of a new agent-based model of exurban residential development and land-management decisions with the ecosystem process model BIOME-BGC. Using a stylized scenario, we evaluate the influence of different exurban residential-land-management strategies on carbon storage at the parcel level over a 48-year period from 1958 to 2005, simulating stocks of carbon in soil, litter, vegetation, and net primary productivity. Results show 1) residential parcels with management practices that only provided additions in the form of fertilizer and irrigation to turfgrass stored slightly more carbon than parcels that did not include management practices, 2) conducting no land-management strategy stored more carbon than implementing a strategy that included removals in the form of removing coarse woody debris from dense tree cover and litter from turfgrass, and 3) the removal practices modelled had a larger impact on total parcel carbon storage than our modelled additions. The degree of variation within the evaluated land-management practices was approximately 42,104 kg C storage on a 1.62 ha plot after 48 years, demonstrating the substantial effect that residential land-management practices can have on carbon storage.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Tree planting is a relevant behavior that may increase when parcels are larger than 0.5 acres (0.20 ha). Yard style of adjacent properties also appears to be related to homeowners’ landscape management behaviors: conventional turf-dominated yards prevail adjacent to parcels smaller than one-acre. We used our analysis of these data to develop an exurban homeowner typology to be employed in agent based models in which homeowners’ behaviors that may affect carbon balance are linked to parcel size.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Agent types, characteristics, behavioural methods, and landscape perceptions (i.e. landscape aesthetics) are empirically informed using survey data, spatial analyses, and a USDA methodology for mapping landscape aesthetic quality. Results from our scenario experiments computationally verified literature that show large lot‐size zoning policies lead to greater sprawl, and large lot‐size zoning policies can lead to increased forest cover, although we found this effect to be small relative to municipal land acquisition.

Furthermore, the location strategy for forest conservation land acquisition was more effective at increasing aggregate forest levels than the independent zoning policies, the quantity of area acquired for forest conservation, and any combination of the two.

We build on an existing agent‐based modeling validation method in order to present a temporal variant‐invariant analysis (TVIA). The enhanced method, which focuses on analyzing the uncertainty in simulation results, examines the degree to which outcomes from multiple model runs match some reference to how land use parcels make the transition from one land use class to another over time.

We sought to identify potential fire behavior in former prairie and savanna following forest succession, and to predict potential fire behavior from plant community data. We collected data on fuel loads, soils, topography, and plant communities from 239 plots at seven sites in the southern Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA. We defined eight plant cover types; an ordination based on tree species basal area by diameter classes and the cover of ground layer functional types supported these community types. Extant prairie and savanna plots had the lowest fuel loads, but there were no consistent differences in fuels among wooded communities. We used a fire behavior model, BehavePlus, to simulate potential fire behavior in our study plots. Because plant community data, standard fuel models and the ordination axes were poor predictors of fuels and potential fire behavior, we explored a new method of incorporating ecological data into predictions of fire behavior. We used classification and regression trees (CARTs) to find groups of plots that differed in their potential fire behavior. Although the best CART explained only 32% of the variance in potential fire behavior, the CARTs suggest ways to more effectively manage fire behavior – for example, indicating the importance of the legacy effects of savanna trees. Our results suggest that the legacies of succession on historic prairie and savanna have led to novel and heterogeneous fuels complexes, making it difficult to predict potential fire behavior from standard fuel models or community types.

At the local scale, habitat heterogeneity can be used to support species persistence by identifying key refugia.

Our results suggest that if temperature and aridity rise as they are projected to, southwestern trees will experience substantially reduced growth during this century. As tree growth declines, mortality rates may increase at many sites. Increases in wildfires and bark-beetle outbreaks in the most recent decade are likely related to extreme drought and high temperatures during this period. Using satellite imagery and aerial survey data, we conservatively calculate that ≈2.7% of southwestern forest and woodland area experienced substantial mortality due to wildfires from 1984 to 2006, and ≈7.6% experienced mortality associated with bark beetles from 1997 to 2008. We estimate that up to ≈18% of southwestern forest area (excluding woodlands) experienced mortality due to bark beetles or wildfire during this period. Expected climatic changes will alter future forest productivity, disturbance regimes, and species ranges throughout the Southwest. Emerging knowledge of these impending transitions informs efforts to adaptively manage southwestern forests.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To flourish, maize needs water, sunlight (heat), and nutrients (e.g., nitrogen). In this paper, climate and soil chemistry data are used to evaluate the potential for dryland (rain-on-field) agriculture in the semiarid southeastern Colorado Plateau and Rio Grande regions. Processes that impact maize agriculture such as nitrogen mineralization, infiltration of precipitation, bare soil evaporation, and transpiration are discussed and evaluated. Most of the study area, excepting high-elevation regions, receives sufficient solar radiation to grow maize. The salinities of subsurface soils in the central San Juan Basin are very high and their nitrogen concentrations are very low. In addition, soils of the central San Juan Basin are characterized by pH values that exceed 8.0, which limit the availability of both nitrogen and phosphorous. In general, the San Juan Basin, including Chaco Canyon, is the least promising part of the study area in terms of dryland farming. Calculations of field life, using values of organic nitrogen for the upper 50 cm of soil in the study area, indicate that most of the study area could not support a 10-bushel/acre crop of maize.

In the central Mesa Verde, but not in the northern Rio Grande, there is a tendency for violence to be greater in periods of low potential maize produccción per capita and high variance in maize produccción, though these structural tendencies were on occasion overridden by historical factors such as the expansion and demise of the Chacoan polity and the regional depopulation. Violence generally declined through time in the northern Rio Grande until the arrival of the Spanish, even as populations increased.

Leaders, through their work in monitoring group members and punishing defectors, can increase the likelihood that group members will cooperate to achieve a favorable outcome in the public-goods game. We show that under certain conditions households prefer to work in a group with a leader who receives a share of the group's productivity, rather than to work in a group with no leader. Simulation produces outcomes that match reasonably well those known for a portion of Southwest Colorado between AD 600 and 900.

In addition, excitation–emission matrix fluorescence data with parallel factor analysis indicate that although the concentration of protein-like components did not differ significantly among watersheds, their relative abundance showed an enrichment in CC and WP compared to REF. The ratio of humic acid-type to fulvic acid-type components was highest and lowest at REF and WP, respectively.

Here, we were interested in how the effects of canopy loss and nutrient leakage from terrestrial areas would translate into functional changes in streams draining affected watersheds. We addressed these questions in HWA-infested watersheds at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in North Carolina. Specifically, we measured stream metabolism (gross primary production and ecosystem respiration) and nitrogen uptake from 2008 to 2011 in five streams across the Coweeta basin. Over the course of our study, we found no change to in-stream nutrient concentrations. While canopy cover decreased annually in these watersheds, this change in light penetration did not translate to higher rates of in-stream primary production during the summer months of our study. We found a trend towards greater heterotrophy within our watersheds, where in-stream respiration accounted for a much larger component of net ecosystem production than GPP. Additionally, increases in rhododendron cover may counteract changes in light and nutrient availability that occurred with hemlock loss.

The former include high quality freshwater, carbon sequestration, nutrient retention, and biodiversity, whereas the latter include flash floods, landslides and forest fires. Each of these ecosystem services and hazards represents different elements of the integrated and co-evolved ecological, hydrological and geomorphic subsystems of the watershed and should be approached analytically as a coupled land system. Forest structure and species are important influences on the partitioning of precipitation, the lateral redistribution of water, runoff and sediment production, weathering and soil development. Forest regulation of hydrologic dynamics contributes to the development of patterns of soil pore pressure and slope instability during storms or snowmelt. The spatial patterns of root depth, structure and strength, developed by the below ground allocation of carbon in the forest canopy in response to limiting resources of water and nutrients, contributes to slope stability and drainage, and the maintenance of stomatal conductance linking water and carbon cycling. This in turn provides the photosynthate required to build leaf area, stem and root biomass. The linked ecological, hydrologic and geomorphic systems are characterized by specific catenary patterns that should be captured in any coupled modeling approach. In this paper we extend an ecohydrological modeling approach to include hydrologic and canopy structural pattern impacts on slope stability, with explicit feedbacks between ecosystem water, carbon and nutrient cycling, and the transient development of landslide potential in steep forested catchments. Using measured distributions of canopy leaf area index, and empirically modeled soil depth and root cohesion, the integrated model is able to generate localized areas of past instability without specific calibration or training with mapped landslides. As the model has previously been shown to simulate space/time patterns of coupled water, carbon and nutrient cycling, the integration of slope stability as a function of hydrologic, ecosystem and geomorphic processes provides the ability to closely link multiple ecosystem services with a unified approach.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

F.",Hydrobiologia,2,2,3,62,8Apr20,"Relative contributions of allochthonous inputs and autochthonous production vary depending on terrestrial land use and biome. Terrestrially derived organic matter and in-stream primary production were measured in 12 headwater streams along an agricultural land-use gradient. Streams were examined to see how carbon (C) supply shifts from forested streams receiving primarily terrestrially derived C to agricultural streams, which may rely primarily on C derived from algal productivity. We measured allochthonous input, chlorophyll a concentration, and periphyton biomass in each stream, and whole-stream metabolism in six streams. Our results suggest a threshold between moderate- and heavy-agriculture land uses in which terrestrially derived C is replaced by in-stream algal productivity as the primary C source for aquatic consumers. A shift from allochthonous to autochthonous production was not evident in all heavy-agriculture streams, and only occurred in heavy-agriculture streams not impacted by livestock grazing. We then compared our findings to rates of allochthonous input and GPP in streams with minimal human influences in multiple biomes to assess how land-use practices influence C sources to stream ecosystems. The proportion of C derived from allochthonous versus autochthonous sources to heavy-agriculture streams was most similar to grassland and desert streams, while C sources to forested, light-, and moderate-agriculture streams were more similar to deciduous and montane coniferous forest streams. We show that C source to streams is dependent on land use, terrestrial biome, and degradation of in-stream conditions. Further, we suggest that within a biome there seems to be a compensation such that total C input is nearly equal whether it is from allochthonous or autochthonous sources.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluate the consistency of these 14 estimates with stream gauge data, both as depleted flow and corrected for net withdrawals (2005 only), at the CONUS and water resource region scale, as well as examining similarity across TBMs and reanalysis products at the grid cell scale. Mean runoff across all simulated products and regions varies widely (range: 71 to 356 mm yr−1) relative to observed continental-scale runoff (209 or 280 mm yr−1 when corrected for net withdrawals). Across all 14 products 8 exhibit Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency values in excess of 0.8 and three are within 10% of the observed value. Region-level mismatch exhibits a weak pattern of overestimation in western and underestimation in eastern regions—although two products are systematically biased across all regions—and largely scales with water use. Although gridded composite TBM and reanalysis runoff show some regional similarities, individual product values are highly variable. At the coarse scales used here we find that progress in better constraining simulated runoff requires standardized forcing data and the explicit incorporation of human effects (e.g., water withdrawals by source, fire, and land use change).",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through early stages of stand development, both elevated [CO2] and availability of soil nitrogen (N; sum of mineralization, deposition, and fixation) have been shown to increase gross primary productivity, but the long‐term effects of these factors on Fsoil are less clear. Expanding on previous studies at the Duke Free‐Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) site, we quantified the effects of elevated [CO2] and N fertilization on Fsoil using daily measurements from automated chambers over 10 years. Consistent with previous results, compared to ambient unfertilized plots, annual Fsoil increased under elevated [CO2] (ca. 17%) and decreased with N (ca. 21%). N fertilization under elevated [CO2] reduced Fsoil to values similar to untreated plots. Over the study period, base respiration rates increased with leaf productivity, but declined after productivity saturated. Despite treatment‐induced differences in aboveground biomass, soil temperature and water content were similar among treatments. Interannually, low soil water content decreased annual Fsoil from potential values – estimated based on temperature alone assuming nonlimiting soil water content – by ca. 0.7% per 1.0% reduction in relative extractable water. This effect was only slightly ameliorated by elevated [CO2]. Variability in soil N availability among plots accounted for the spatial variability in Fsoil, showing a decrease of ca. 114 g C m−2 yr−1 per 1 g m−2 increase in soil N availability, with consistently higher Fsoil in elevated [CO2] plots ca. 127 g C per 100 ppm [CO2] over the +200 ppm enrichment.

Deducing from these data the value of the good (or bad) at the core of the program – the welfare gain generated by a parcel of conserved land, for instance, or the loss incurred by a species invasion – often is not possible because respondent preferences are conflated with their expectations about future environmental outcomes in the absence of the program. This paper formally demonstrates this conundrum in the context of a standard contingent valuation survey, and examines the use of additional survey data to resolve it. The application is to the prevention of lake invasions by Eurasian Watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum), an invasive aquatic plant that is present in many lakes in the northern U.S. and Canada and a possible threat to many more.

The estimated per-property welfare loss of a lake invasion is $30,550 for one model and $23,614 for another, both of which are in reasonable agreement with estimates obtained from a recent hedonic analysis of Eurasian Watermilfoil invasions in the study area [16], and from a companion contingent valuation survey of shoreline property owners on already-invaded lakes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their impacts are often linked to their population size, but surprisingly little is known about how frequently they achieve high abundances. A nearly universal pattern in ecology is that species are rare in most locations and abundant in a few, generating right-skewed abundance distributions. Here, we use abundance data from over 24,000 populations of 17 invasive and 104 native aquatic species to test whether invasive species differ from native counterparts in statistical patterns of abundance across multiple sites. Invasive species on average reached significantly higher densities than native species and exhibited significantly higher variance. However, invasive and native species did not differ in terms of coefficient of variation, skewness, or kurtosis. Abundance distributions of all species were highly right skewed (skewness>0), meaning both invasive and native species occurred at low densities in most locations where they were present. The average abundance of invasive and native species was 6% and 2%, respectively, of the maximum abundance observed within a taxonomic group. The biological significance of the differences between invasive and native species depends on species-specific relationships between abundance and impact. Recognition of cross-site heterogeneity in population densities brings a new dimension to invasive species management, and may help to refine optimal prevention, containment, control, and eradication strategies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Chinese mystery snail (Bellamya chinensis) is a large invasive gastropod that achieves high densities in waters across North America, yet little is known about its ecological significance in invaded systems. We surveyed 44 lakes to describe the patterns and determinants of B. chinensis distributions in northern Wisconsin, USA, and to assess the likelihood of effects on native snail communities in the invaded systems. B. chinensis was widespread among surveyed lakes (21 of 42 lakes with snails) and its occurrence was correlated with indicators of lake productivity and anthropogenic dispersal vectors (boat landings, distance to population centers, shoreline housing density). Some native snail species tended not to occur at sites where B. chinensis was abundant; among these was Lymnaea stagnalis, which suffered reduced survival in the presence of B. chinensis in a recently published mesocosm study. However, there was no difference in overall snail assemblage structure at either the site or lake level as a function of B. chinensis presence or abundance. Lake occurrences of many snail species have apparently been lost over time, but a comparison to a 1930s survey showed that there was no increased likelihood of species loss in lakes invaded by B. chinensis (or by the invasive crayfish Orconectes rusticus). Although B. chinensis is widespread and sometimes abundant in northern Wisconsin lakes, it does not appear to have strong systematic impacts on native snail assemblages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Distribution models use environmental characteristics of observed distributions to determine the suite of conditions that allows invasion. Some variables are directly related to species’ biological needs, while others are surrogates that do not directly influence distributions. For aquatic invasive species (AIS) with calcified shells and exoskeletons, one common limiting factor is the chemical restriction on forming calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which is usually represented by conductivity or dissolved calcium. We predicted that conductivity and calcium would not serve as accurate surrogates for CaCO3 saturation state, which is more directly linked to calcification potential. To test this prediction, we fit classification trees to field surveys of northern Wisconsin lakes for three calcifying AIS—rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus), banded mystery snail (Viviparus georgianus), and Chinese mystery snail (Cipanguladina chinensis). Along with lake area, variables associated with calcification were the best predictors of species distributions. Even though saturation state is the most biologically mechanistic variable, it did not improve model predictions or explain more variability in species presence than its surrogates. Overall, surrogates are sufficient for species distribution modeling in these lakes that exhibit a wide range of chemical states.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The quality of these fisheries can be affected not only by harvest but also by catch-and-release practices. Documenting catch and release among sport fish taxa is, therefore, important to fisheries researchers studying sport fishes and managers regulating these fisheries. We used an angler diary survey to assess taxon-specific effort, catch, harvest, release, and reason for release during the 2011 open-water season. Our study included information on 5,007 fishing trips taken by 652 anglers. These anglers visited 279 lakes spanning 11,761.5 km2 of northern Wisconsin. Muskellunge Esox masquinongy, black bass (i.e., Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu and Largemouth Bass M. salmoides), Northern Pike E. lucius, Walleye Sander vitreus, and panfish were released at rates of 99, 97, 86, 67, and 67%, respectively, when targeted by anglers. This study is the first to document black bass catch-and-release rates in the region and corroborates previous findings of Muskellunge and Walleye catch-and-release rates based on creel surveys. Voluntary catch and release was the most common reason for release. Our findings suggest that regulations may be much more generous than the harvest rates practiced by anglers and that catch-and-release angling practices may be an important factor affecting these sport fish populations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grant.3100938,909281,Using an Intervention Framework to Value Salient Ecosystem Services in a Stated Preference Experiment,2015,Lewis et al. ,Ecological Economics,1,1,1,5,9Apr2020,"To estimate the value of an improvement in the provision of an ecosystem service, analysts often use an intervention framework in a stated preference experiment. An intervention framework is defined by (i) an intervention, such as a publicly-funded program, and (ii) the intervention effect — the difference in the provision of the ecosystem service with and without the intervention. The contention of this paper is that if the purpose of an experiment is to estimate the value of the intervention effect, rather than the intervention itself, consideration needs to be given to the saliency of the service to the respondent population, because for salient services respondents often have prior beliefs about the intervention effect, and if these prior beliefs are different on average than implicitly assumed or explicitly presented in the choice experiment, the estimate of the value of the improvement will be biased. We emphasize that in some cases a structural model can be used to identify the value of the intervention effect, whereas for others, only the value of the intervention can be identified. We illustrate the issue using two case studies concerning ecosystem service provision on freshwater lakes, prevention of aquatic species invasions, and fish habitat enhancement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I present a novel methodological approach to assess the importance boaters placed on 16 water issues in a lake‐rich region of northern Wisconsin. A latent class maximum difference conjoint model was used to examine the relationships between environmental concern and engagement with lake resources. Boaters were grouped to maximize observed heterogeneity in prioritizing issues of concern. Socio‐demographic characteristics, recreation specialization, place attachment, and attitudes concerning aquatic stewardship and invasive species management were then used to predict class membership. This modeling approach identified five groups whose perceptions of issues pertaining to lakes are influenced by their interactions with the lake environment. While anglers were most concerned about fishing quality, sightseers identified lakeshore development and loss of natural habitat. Groups also differed in their socio‐demographic and attitudinal characteristics. The priorities of each group were substantially different from those of the overall sample. Accounting for differences in stakeholders' environmental concerns may improve public involvement in water management initiatives by allowing managers to identify common concerns and prioritize important issues among multiple groups.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigate how structural and behavioral factors may influence collective decision making in the context of ecological restoration, with the purpose of establishing general relationships between management styles (defined by structural and behavioral factors of the organization) and decision outcomes. Informed by existing literature on collective decision making and by empirical data from the Chicago Wilderness region, we present a stylized agent-based model that maps out and simulates the processes by which individuals within restoration organizations communicate, discuss, and ultimately make a decision. Our study examines how structural and behavioral characteristics— including: (a) the number of actors and groups involved in decision making, (b) the frequency and type of interactions among actors, (c) the initial setup of positions and respect, (d) outside information, and (e) entrenchment and cost of dissent—lead to or prohibit group convergence in terms of collective position, variation in position across actors, and final decision strategies. We found that formal meetings and group leaders are important facilitators of convergence, especially when multiple groups are present, new information is introduced in the process, and participants are polarized around an issue. Also, intergroup interactions are particularly important for overall convergence. Position entrenchment slows the convergence process and increases the need for decision strategies involving outside intervention. Cost of dissent can reinforce these effects. Our study formalizes collective decision-making processes within the context of ecological restoration, establishes generalizable relationships between these processes and decision outcomes, and provides a foundation for further empirical and modeling research.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rates of spread accelerated nearly twofold as age at first reproduction decreased from eight to three years or fecundity increased from 3 to 20 offspring per year, illustrating the need to better understand the factors that influence these life‐history traits. Canopy gaps facilitated spread by influencing these life‐history traits, but not through their effects on dispersal. Invasions starting at the woodland center spread more rapidly than do those starting along the woodland edge. These findings suggest that managers should not only prioritize the removal of shrubs that reproduce the earliest or produce the most offspring, but they should also focus on the invasions in woodlands with high canopy openness and/or that are located in woodland interiors. Investigated factors also affected other invasion characteristics, often in surprising ways. For example, those changes in age at first reproduction and fecundity that increased the rate of spread produced nonparallel patterns of change in the proportions of invasion reproducing, whether or not invasions exhibited clumped or scattered spatial arrangements, and invasional lag. Additionally, canopy gaps influenced these characteristics by increasing fecundity, but not by decreasing age at first reproduction or altering dispersal, suggesting that canopy gaps affect local patterns of exotic‐shrub invasions primarily through their positive effects on fruit production.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As such, it is critical to understand these processes and the factors that might influence the resolution of diverse perspectives into a set of coordinated actions. This paper describes the adaptation and calibration of a stylized collective decision-making agent-based model using ethnographic data, to advance theory on how decisions emerge in the context of ecological restoration in the Chicago Wilderness. The prototypical model provided structure and organization of the empirical data of two Chicago Wilderness member groups and revealed organizational structures, patterns of interactions via formal and informal meetings, and parameter values for the various mechanisms. The organization of the data allowed us to identify where our original model mechanisms required adaptation. After model modifications were completed, baseline scenarios were contrasted with observations for final parameter calibration and to elaborate explanations of the study cases. This exercise allowed us to identify the components and mechanisms in the system to which the outputs are most sensitive. We constructed relevant hypothetical scenarios around these critical components, and found that key liaisons, agents with high interaction frequencies and high mutual respect values are useful in promoting efficient decision processes, but are limited in their ability to change the collective position with respect to a restoration practice. Simulations suggest that final collective position can be changed when there is a more equitable distribution of agents across groups, or the key liaison is very persuasive (i.e. interacts frequently and is highly respected) but is non-reciprocal (i.e. does not respect others highly). Our work advances our understanding of key mechanisms influencing collective decision processes and illustrates the value of agent-based modeling and its integration with ethnographic data analysis to advance the theory of collective decision making.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peri-urbanization, a specific form of urbanization characterized by rapid and fragmented growth, is also increasing, especially in developing countries. By 2030, it is anticipated that peri-urban areas in East Asia will expand by 200 million people, or 40% of total projected urban population growth, creating in these areas one of the largest and most significant land cover changes in the region. Characterizing and understanding the peri-urbanization process is critical, as these transition zones have a wide range of impacts across multiple scales, including local effects on farmer livelihoods, regional impacts to economic development, fragmented governance, as well as detrimental environmental impacts such as increased air and groundwater pollution, loss of native vegetation, and decreases in biodiversity. Yet the dynamic and piecemeal nature of peri-urbanization presents challenges for monitoring this unique process. This research combines commune-level Vietnamese census information, dense time stacks of Landsat satellite data (1990–2012), and several spatial measures to quantify urbanization and peri-urbanization in the greater Ho Chi Minh City metropolitan area from 1990 to 2012. The results indicate that 660.2 km2 of cropland was converted to urban uses (a near quintupling of urban land), while 3.5 million persons moved into the region, bringing the total population to nearly 12 million by 2012. The analysis also highlights the rapid, unplanned nature of peri-urban development: approximately one-third of new urban expansion occurs in areas >40 km from the core, with nearly 50% of population expansion occurring in communes classified as peri-urban. This pattern of growth is likely linked to policies meant to spur foreign investment, and we expect that these regions will continue to attract much, if not most, of the foreign direct investment (FDI) flowing to the region, since most large manufacturing enterprises now locate in peri-urban areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Large-scale in-migration of young people, usually from poor regions, creates enormous demand and expectations for community and social services. One immediate problem planners face in approaching this challenge is how to define, differentiate, and map what is rural, urban, and transitional (i.e., peri-urban). This project established an urban classification for Vietnam by using national census and remote sensing data to identify and map the smallest administrative units for which data are collected as rural, peri-urban, urban, or urban core. We used both natural and human factors in the quantitative model: income from agriculture, land under agriculture and forests, houses with modern sanitation, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Model results suggest that in 2006, 71% of Vietnam's 10,891 communes were rural, 18% peri-urban, 3% urban, and 4% urban core. Of the communes our model classified as peri-urban, 61% were classified by the Vietnamese government as rural. More than 7% of Vietnam's land area can be classified as peri-urban and approximately 13% of its population (more than 11 million people) lives in peri-urban areas. We identified and mapped three types of peri-urban places: communes in the periphery of large towns and cities; communes along highways; and communes associated with provincial administration or home to industrial, energy, or natural resources projects (e.g., mining). We validated this classification based on ground observations, analyses of multi-temporal night-time lights data, and an examination of road networks. The model provides a method for rapidly assessing the rural–urban nature of places to assist planners in identifying rural areas undergoing rapid change with accompanying needs for investments in building, sanitation, road infrastructure, and government institutions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent research on those and other species found larval retention is greater, dispersal distances shorter, and demographic connectivity therefore more localized than previously thought. We illustrate these patterns for two western North Atlantic fisheries species, Atlantic cod and American lobsters. Self-organizing spatial patterns also arise in the human social part of the system, but because of biological spatial complexity, geographic boundaries of social organization are unlikely to mirror those of ecological organization. Consequently, no set of management boundaries can perfectly delineate the distribution of organisms within an ecosystem or the social structure that has grown up around them. Reliance on any single scale of management creates perverse incentives—at large scales it encourages roving bandits, at small scales stationary banditry. Nevertheless, at smaller scales, social connectivity is high and feedback about ecological effects of human activity is less ambiguous, permitting rapid, but locally biased, learning. We argue that only strong governance functioning at multiple nested scales can negotiate the spatial restraints on fishing necessary to suppress these perverse incentives. We use an analogy with international trade to illustrate the incentive problems that arise when valuable resources cross ecologically arbitrary political boundaries. We conclude that the need for multiscale governance results from the spatial/temporal heterogeneity of biological systems.

American lobsters (Homarus americanus) evolved in the North Atlantic under conditions of intense predation from large finfish such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Lobster’s relatively extended brood period and large larval size result in high per capita pelagic phase survival, which, coupled with settlement habitat selection for predator refugia, contributes to the species’ high lifetime reproductive success. However, the western North Atlantic is an extremely low diversity ecosystem prone to booms and busts. Extirpation of coastal predators released past constraints on lobster population growth such that lobster landings increased three- to five-fold since 1980 in Canada and the US. Climate change may stress lobsters in some regions and enhance stocks elsewhere, but it also facilitates warm-water species distribution shift northward. As lobster population densities and water temperatures increase, so do risks and consequences of disease. In the future we must expect the unexpected. “Equilibrium” conditions on which traditional fisheries management depends simply do not exist.

Fish and invertebrate spatial distributions from the National Marine Fisheries Service demersal trawl survey conducted in the Georges Bank – Gulf of Maine region were analyzed by bootstrapped principal component analysis (PCABtsp) and normal PCA (PCANrml). PCABtsp produced confidence limits for eigenvalue stopping rules and for eigenvectors to identify significantly correlated species. Stopping rules identified the first six principal components (PCs) as relevant. Initially, summer and fall survey data from 1963 to 2006 were analyzed, but high eigenvector variation led to reductions in the species and time series used. Confidence interval variation was achieved through removal of highly migratory species and restriction of the time series. PC scores were mapped using inverse distance weighted interpolation to reveal multispecies spatial arrangements. Core areas of species groupings and overlapping zones of higher diversity can be delineated and, even under high fishing pressure with large compositional changes, the assemblages maintained robust spatial organization.

We developed an operating model to simulate a fishery using US Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) as our model species. This population consists of two well-defined spawning substocks distributed and mixed in four management areas. Simulations were done for three alternative “true” populations, each having a different spatial structure both biologically and with regard to the geographic distribution of fishing effort. Stock assessments were then performed for the three simulated “true” populations using standard methodologies and assumptions currently used. Management-area-based assessments lead to overestimation of spawning stock biomass and underestimation of fishing mortality because of the interaction within the management area between the spatial structure of the population and that of the spatially heterogeneous fishery removals. In contrast, when fishing is spatially homogeneous, movement across management boundaries may not be relevant to modeling population dynamics.

The opposites of these traits tend to characterize the disadvantaged, such as the middle-ground opinions, the less wealthy or organized, and the more remote stakeholders. Remoteness or distance is the most straightforward and objective of these characteristics to measure. We analyzed the New England Fishery Management Council’s sign-in sheets for 2003–2006, estimating participants’ travel distance and associations with the groundfish, scallop, and herring industries. We also evaluated the representativeness of participation by comparing attendance to landings and permit distributions. The distance analysis showed a significant correlation between attendance levels and costs via travel distance. These results suggest a potential bias toward those stakeholders residing closer to meeting locations, possibly disadvantaging parties who are further and must incur higher costs. However, few significant differences were found between the actual fishing industry and attendee distributions, suggesting that the geographical distribution of the meeting attendees is statistically similar to that of the larger fishery. The interpretation of these results must take into consideration the limited time span of the analysis, as policy changes may have altered the industry make-up and location prior to our study. Furthermore, the limited geographical input of stakeholders may lend bias to the Council’s perception of ecological and social conditions throughout the spatial range of the fishery. These factors should be further considered in the policy-formation process in order to incorporate a broader range of stakeholder input.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently there is an effort in the Maine lobster industry to get lower trap limits, which provides an opportunity to get detailed information on the political factors influencing legislation in an important and highly successful industry. In many industries, including the Maine lobster industry, many laws come in the aftermath of conflict between industry factions seeking laws to get distributional benefits. In the Maine lobster industry, the politics of getting lower trap limits are byzantine. Two factions have different models of the fishery, leading them to advocate different policies. The positions of people in each faction are very complicated. Those favoring a lower trap limit assume the industry is highly inefficient and that a lower trap limit would result in better catches per trap haul, lower costs of operations and higher profits. Some of those opposing a trap limit assume fishing more traps will lower profits; others assume it will raise profits. Those opposing lower trap limits offer five different sets of reasons for their viewpoint. To date, efforts to impose a lower trap limit have been blocked, but a number of factors could change the strength of the factions and tip the balance. In this industry, resource management policy is being made in an atmosphere in which different industry groups are pulling in different directions for complex sets of reasons.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Controversy exists, however, in terms of the biological reference point (BRP) used in assessing lobster stock status, and there is no fully established or evaluated harvest control rule (HCR). A sex-specific, size-dependent operating model is developed to evaluate the performance of two HCRs, discrete and continuous, which adjust annual fishing mortality discretely and linearly, respectively, based on the status of the fishery. For each HCR, different BRPs are considered along with management duration, recruitment dynamics, and natural mortality. HCRs with a suitable set of BRPs can drive the fishery from an undesirable status to an optimal status. The continuous HCR tends to perform better than the discrete one. The Ftarget of 0.31 year−1 showed the best performance in the long term by balancing the needs of the fishing industry and conservation bodies. However, this was not the case in the short term. An Ntarget of 49.6 million would allow the American lobster to be maintained at its current stock level, with high recruitment and stable natural mortality.

In this study, using data collected from an inshore bottom trawl survey, we evaluated seasonal and annual variations in the spatial distribution of the fish community in the coastal Gulf of Maine. We identified key environmental drivers important in structuring the fish community, including longitudinal strata, distance offshore, depth, bottom temperature, bottom salinity and substrate type. This study suggests linear relationships between the fish abundances and the environmental variables. This linear relationship is more obvious if integrating fish species as a whole group than clustering them into subgroups. However, as large temporal variability exists for some species subgroups in their spatial structure, environmental variables can still be difficult to predict the spatial distributions of species groups.

One of the most important conservation measures is the V-notch program that allows fishermen to conserve proven breeding females by notching the tails of egg-bearing lobsters. Such marked lobsters may never be taken. Although thousands of lobster fishermen participate, it is a voluntary practice. The genesis of this practice is not easily explained, because V-notching poses a prisoner’s dilemma problem that gives fishermen an incentive to avoid the practice. The most common explanations for ways to overcome prisoner’s dilemma problems will not work in the case of the V-notch. An unusual combination of factors explains the V-notch program: (1) a strong belief among those in the industry that the V-notch is effective in conserving the lobster stock; (2) a low discount rate because the long-term gains from V-notching are higher than the one-time gain from defection; (3) a gain in reputation for those who V-notch. At the start of the 20th century, fishermen did not V-notch; by the end of the century, V-notching was common.

We investigate how structural and behavioral factors may influence collective decision making in the context of ecological restoration, with the purpose of establishing general relationships between management styles (defined by structural and behavioral factors of the organization) and decision outcomes. Informed by existing literature on collective decision making and by empirical data from the Chicago Wilderness region, we present a stylized agent-based model that maps out and simulates the processes by which individuals within restoration organizations communicate, discuss, and ultimately make a decision. Our study examines how structural and behavioral characteristics— including: (a) the number of actors and groups involved in decision making, (b) the frequency and type of interactions among actors, (c) the initial setup of positions and respect, (d) outside information, and (e) entrenchment and cost of dissent—lead to or prohibit group convergence in terms of collective position, variation in position across actors, and final decision strategies. We found that formal meetings and group leaders are important facilitators of convergence, especially when multiple groups are present, new information is introduced in the process, and participants are polarized around an issue. Also, intergroup interactions are particularly important for overall convergence. Position entrenchment slows the convergence process and increases the need for decision strategies involving outside intervention. Cost of dissent can reinforce these effects. Our study formalizes collective decision-making processes within the context of ecological restoration, establishes generalizable relationships between these processes and decision outcomes, and provides a foundation for further empirical and modeling research.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper analyzes the patterns of groundwater exploitation when resource users in the area overlying a common aquifer are heterogeneous. In the presence of user heterogeneity, the common resource problem consists of inefficient dynamic and spatial allocation of groundwater because it impacts income distribution not only across periods but also across farmers. Under competitive allocation, smaller farmers pump groundwater faster if farmers have a constant marginal periodic utility of income. However, it is possible that larger farmers pump faster if the Arrow-Pratt coefficient of relative risk-aversion is sufficiently decreasing in income. A greater farm-size inequality may either moderate or amplify income inequality among farmers. Its effect on welfare depends on the curvature properties of the agricultural output function and the farmer utility of income. Also, it is shown that a flat-rate quota policy that limits the quantity of groundwater extraction per unit land area may have unintended consequences for the income distribution among farmers.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The changes in canopy area of phreatophytes over time is related to changes in depth to groundwater, distance from a stream or river, and hydrologic soil group. Remote sensing was used to determine the location of trees with pre-development and post-development aerial photography over the Ogallala Aquifer in the central plains of the United States. It was found that once the depth to groundwater becomes greater than about 3 m, tree populations decrease as depth to water increases. This subsequently limited the extent of phreatophytes to within 700 m of the river. It was also found that phreatophytes have a higher likelihood of growing on hydrologic soil groups with higher saturated hydraulic conductivity. Phreatophytes exist along portions of the Arkansas River corridor where significant decreases in groundwater occurred as long as alluvium exists to create perched conditions where trees survive dry periods. Significant decreases (more that 50%) in canopy cover exists along river segments where groundwater declined by more than 10 m, indicating areas with good hydraulic connectivity between surface water and groundwater. Thus, interpretation of changes in phreatophyte distribution using historical and recent aerial photography is important in delineating zones of enhanced recharge where aquifers might be effectively recharged through diversion of surface water runoff.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We adapt the Analytic Element Method (AEM) to extend separation of variable solutions for a rectangle to domains composed of multiple interconnected rectangular elements. Each rectangle contains a series solution that satisfies the governing equations and coefficients are adjusted to match boundary conditions at the edge of the domain and continuity conditions across adjacent rectangles. A complete mathematical implementation is presented including matrices to solve boundary and continuity conditions. This approach gathers the mathematical functions associated with head and velocity within a small set of functions for each rectangle, enabling fast computation of these variables. Benchmark studies verify that conservation of mass and energy conditions are accurately satisfied using a method of images solution, and also develop a solution for heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity with log normal distribution. A case study illustrates that the methods are capable of modeling local detail within a large-scale regional model of the High Plains Aquifer in the central USA and reports the numerical costs associated with increasing resolution, where use is made of GIS datasets for thousands of rectangular elements each with unique geologic and hydrologic properties, Methods are applicable to interconnected rectangular domains in other fields of study such as heat conduction, electrical conduction, and unsaturated groundwater flow.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results show that mean annual precipitation (from 1985–2005) is partitioned into 13% runoff regionally and 14% locally over the Konza LTER, lateral flow through soil is 1% regionally and 2% locally, groundwater recharge is 11% regionally and 9% locally, and evapotranspiration accounts for the remaining 75%.

The resistance was set to fixed representative values during model calibration of hydraulic conductivity, and simple log-log relations correlate the enhanced recharge beneath ephemeral upland streams and baseflow in perennial lowland streams to the unknown resistance of the streambeds. Enhanced recharge due to stream transmission loss (the difference between terrestrial runoff and streamflow) represents a small fraction of streamflow in the ephemeral upland and the resistance of this streambed is 100 000 day.

Understanding these process interactions across domains is an important step in establishing effective and sustainable policy. Multidisciplinary integrated models can provide insight to inform this understanding, though the extent of software development necessary is often prohibitive, particularly for small teams of researchers. Thus there is a need for practical methods for building interdisciplinary integrated models that do not incur a substantial development effort. In this work we adopt the strategy of linking individual domain models together to build a multidisciplinary integrated model. The software development effort is minimized through the reuse of existing models and existing model-linking tools without requiring any changes to the model source codes, and linking these components through the use of the Open Modeling Interface (OpenMI). This was found to be an effective approach to building an agricultural-groundwater-economic integrated model for studying the effects of water policy in irrigated agricultural systems. The construction of the integrated model provided a means to evaluate the impacts of two alternative water-use policies aimed at reducing irrigated water use to sustainable levels in the semi-arid grasslands overlying the Ogallala Aquifer of the Central US. The results show how both the economic impact in terms of yield and revenue and the environmental impact in terms of groundwater level vary spatially throughout the study region for each policy.

In addition, mT was significantly related to vulnerability to cavitation of branches (P50). While mT did not appear to differ between ring- and diffuse-porous species, the relationship between mT and P50 was distinct by wood anatomy.

This entailed the development of a proposed new, ecosystem services‐based classification of tree species traits is based on ∼1000 household surveys of the preferences of urban residents for specific tree attributes in southern California. We evaluated the relationship between leaf functional traits, ecosystem services‐based traits, and urban tree performance as measured by stem growth and predawn leaf water potential (as a metric of rooting distributions). Leaf functional traits were strongly predictable based on species' biogeographic region of origin including native habitat type and continent of origin, and hence appeared to be conserved in the urban environment. Ecosystem services‐based traits such as tree water use, provision of showy flowers, size at maturity, and growth rates were also predictable based on geographic region of origin, and several ecosystem services‐based traits were related to leaf functional traits. We suggest that ecosystem services‐based traits may be useful variables to quantify in studies of urban forest community assembly, where species composition is strongly influenced by decision‐making based on the preferences of urban residents and stakeholders. Our initial ecosystem services‐based trait classification is defined from the results of household surveys and measurements in the Los Angeles area; these results are likely to vary by location, and can be improved with additional data on the performance, physiology, and morphology of urban trees as well as a better understanding of human preferences by region.",Also listed in grant 919381,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantifying biogeochemical processes in urban green infrastructure can improve our understanding of urban ecosystem services and disservices (negative or unintended consequences) resulting from designed urban green spaces.

However, hydrology and ecology are still closely linked in semi‐arid urban ecosystems in which surface characteristics, vegetation, and water flows are all highly transformed. Although these systems are human‐dominated, there are many uncertainties in the water budgets of semi‐arid cities, because evapotranspiration, runoff, groundwater recharge, and leakage are poorly constrained. Decision‐making, governance, and socioeconomic factors play important roles in determining urban hydrologic budgets. We offer a framework to integrate these factors in studies that combine biophysical and social dimensions of the urban water system using the example of western US cities, which are facing critical issues in water supply and demand, and which can benefit from a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that determine water consumption, distribution and availability. Because of the severity of the water crisis in the western US, and the biophysical, institutional, and cultural barriers to developing and implementing new water management practices, this region provides useful lessons for addressing water challenges in other regions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two alternate hypotheses describing urban landscape trajectories suggest urbanization is either leading to more homogeneous global patterns or urbanization has dichotomous trajectories of increasing dispersal or coalescence. To better understand the global variation in urban land-cover patterns and trajectories we described the variation in urban landscape structure for 120 cities distributed throughout the world assessed at circa 1990 and 2000. We coupled these data to a low-dimensional neighborhood based model of urban growth using a data-model fusion approach. Trajectories of urban growth were assessed using both the original data and model projections to 2030. The patterns of landscape change were related to both the rate of growth and income. The historical patterns of change showed a trend of increasing landscape complexity and this trend was projected to continue. Urban rate of growth was closely related to the change in several landscape metrics. Income was associated with landscape dynamics and this effect interacted with city size. Large cities were less sensitive to the income effect than small cities. Along with changes to the magnitude of each metric, the overall variation in metrics between years generally exhibited a decrease in variability and this variability was projected to continue decreasing. These findings supported the hypothesis that urban landscapes are becoming more homogeneous and that the dispersal-coalescing dichotomy represent endpoints rather than alternate states of urban growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results from landscape experiments complement the many well developed observational and modeling approaches more commonly used in landscape ecology. To better understand how landscape experimentation has been conducted and to identify future research directions, we reviewed and organized the diversity of experiments. We identified fifteen distinct landscape experiment types, which we categorized into four broad groups including (I) identifying landscape structure, (II) identifying how ecological processes vary within existing landscapes, (III) identifying how landscape structure influences ecological processes, and (IV) identifying landscape pattern formation factors. Experiment types vary along axes of scalable to real landscapes and generalizability, suitability for analysis through traditional experimental design and flexibility of experimental setup, and complexity of implementation and resource requirements. The next generation of experiments are benefiting from more explicit inclusion of scaling theories and tighter coupling between experiments and cyberinfrastructure. Future experimental opportunities for landscape ecologists include expanded collaborations among experiments, better representations of microbial-soil structure relationships at microscales, and direct evaluations of landscape interactions with global changes.

Tree species information was collected spanning a 110-year study period and analyzed the data for four time periods (1900–1929, 1930–1959, 1960–1989, and 1990–2011). We found the number of genera and tree species offered significantly increased in the past 20 years (1990–2011). The numbers of non-native trees, angiosperms, and deciduous species all significantly increased with but no changes were observed in the numbers of native, evergreen, or gymnosperm species offered over this time period.

However, in arid and semiarid regions, urban trees must be maintained through supplemental irrigation. In these regions it is desirable to identify tree species that are especially efficient in the balance between water loss and carbon uptake. We used a common‐garden approach to compare water‐use efficiency (WUE) at leaf and tree scales for commonly planted, nonnative tree species in the Los Angeles Basin (California, USA), in order to evaluate WUE as a metric of the trade‐off between water use and growth in urban trees. Leaf‐level gas exchange, sap flux density, leaf δ13C, and stem growth measurements were conducted on eight species within the Los Angeles County Arboretum: Brachychiton discolor, B. populneus, Eucalyptus grandis, Ficus microcarpa, Jacaranda chelonia, Gleditsia triacanthos, Lagerstroemia indica, and Koelreuteria paniculata. We found species with high instantaneous WUE also had the highest tree‐level seasonal WUE (stem basal‐area increment (BAI)/total transpiration). High tree‐level WUE resulted from low water use in B. discolor, B. populneus, and E. grandis. In contrast, high basal‐area growth explained moderately high WUE in F. microcarpa. Notably, high WUE was not associated with low BAI. At a monthly time scale, nearly all species showed the highest WUE during late spring/early summer, when the majority of basal‐area growth occurred. Although leaf‐ and tree‐level WUE were reasonably well correlated, leaf δ13C was not significantly related to leaf‐ or tree‐level WUE. Overall, the most water‐efficient species were evergreen, or from regions that experience high vapor‐pressure deficit (VPD). These results suggest that whole‐tree WUE is a useful measure of the balance between some critical costs and benefits of irrigated urban trees and may be helpful in determining which trees should be planted to maximize growth while conserving water. Although measuring whole‐tree WUE directly provides the most complete understanding of urban tree costs and benefits, this study suggests that leaf‐level instantaneous measurements of WUE and knowledge of species native climates may be reasonable proxies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Urban vegetation may provide a cooling ecosystem service, although many knowledge gaps exist in the biophysical and social dynamics of using this service to reduce climate extremes. To better understand patterns of urban vegetated cooling, the potential water requirements to supply these services, and differential access to these services between residential neighborhoods, we evaluated three decades (1970–2000) of land surface characteristics and residential segregation by income in the Phoenix, Arizona, USA metropolitan region. We developed an ecosystem service trade‐offs approach to assess the urban heat riskscape, defined as the spatial variation in risk exposure and potential human vulnerability to extreme heat. In this region, vegetation provided nearly a 25°C surface cooling compared to bare soil on low‐humidity summer days; the magnitude of this service was strongly coupled to air temperature and vapor pressure deficits. To estimate the water loss associated with land‐surface cooling, we applied a surface energy balance model. Our initial estimates suggest 2.7 mm/d of water may be used in supplying cooling ecosystem services in the Phoenix region on a summer day. The availability and corresponding resource use requirements of these ecosystem services had a strongly positive relationship with neighborhood income in the year 2000. However, economic stratification in access to services is a recent development: no vegetation–income relationship was observed in 1970, and a clear trend of increasing correlation was evident through 2000. To alleviate neighborhood inequality in risks from extreme heat through increased vegetation and evaporative cooling, large increases in regional water use would be required. Together, these results suggest the need for a systems evaluation of the benefits, costs, spatial structure, and temporal trajectory for the use of ecosystem services to moderate climate extremes. Increasing vegetation is one strategy for moderating regional climate changes in urban areas and simultaneously providing multiple ecosystem services. However, vegetation has economic, water, and social equity implications that vary dramatically across neighborhoods and need to be managed through informed environmental policies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alpha (α) and beta (β) tree biodiversity were quantified using sample based rarefaction curves. Hypotheses of independent climate, land use, luxury and legacy effects were evaluated with residual regression analysis and best models were chosen using AIC. Residential land use had the highest α biodiversity at all sampling scales, but the lowest β diversity, possibly indicating a limited plant pool for managers. Increased median household income was independently related to each type of vegetation cover, supporting a luxury effect. Regression models explaining the most variation in cover also included population density. In contrast, tree species richness was only positively related to housing age, supporting the legacy effect. Median income had no independent effect on tree biodiversity, which contrasts with patterns in other arid cities. However, age and income had an interactive effect. The highest α and β tree diversity were found in old, high-income locations. Managing for ecosystem services provided by vegetation should prioritize low income neighborhoods for increasing cover, while managing for biodiversity should maintain existing diversity in older neighborhoods and encourage new species in newer neighborhoods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To make substantive progress towards urban sustainability, city managers and researchers need to know where, when, how and which greening programmes are appropriate for urban areas. Simplified urban-forest models have been widely used to estimate the benefits of scattered planting of trees in city parks and avenues, but these mostly fail to build in estimates of uncertainty or to consider trade-offs and costs. For example, urban forests would be unlikely to reduce atmospheric concentrations of polluting particulates and nitrogen dioxide (H. Setälä et al. Environ. Pollut. 183, 104–112; 2013), and their high pollen density could exacerbate respiratory conditions such as asthma. We suggest, therefore, that urban-greening strategies should be tailored specifically to their localities. Programmes need to be validated by testing against comparative studies that capture spatial and temporal variability in and among cities. This means that local urban data collection and ecosystem modelling will have to meet the same high standards as those applied to non-urban areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found a strong linear relationship between the sensitivity of tree-level transpiration estimated from sap flux (mT; slope of the relationship between tree transpiration and ln D) and transpiration at D = 1 kPa (ETref) that was similar to previous surveys of stomatal behavior in natural environments. In addition, mT was significantly related to vulnerability to cavitation of branches (P50). While mT did not appear to differ between ring- and diffuse-porous species, the relationship between mT and P50 was distinct by wood anatomy. Therefore, our study confirms systematic differences in water relations in ring- versus diffuse-porous species, but these differences appear to be more strongly related to the relationship between stomatal sensitivity to D and vulnerability to cavitation rather than to stomatal sensitivity per se.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Li et al. ,Biogeochemistry,3,3,3,76,19Mar20,"Global ecosystem models may require microbial components to accurately predict feedbacks between climate warming and soil decomposition, but it is unclear what parameters and levels of complexity are ideal for scaling up to the globe. Here we conducted a model comparison using a conventional model with first-order decay and three microbial models of increasing complexity that simulate short- to long-term soil carbon dynamics. We focused on soil carbon responses to microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) and temperature. Three scenarios were implemented in all models: constant CUE (held at 0.31), varied CUE (−0.016 °C−1), and 50 % acclimated CUE (−0.008 °C−1). Whereas the conventional model always showed soil carbon losses with increasing temperature, the microbial models each predicted a temperature threshold above which warming led to soil carbon gain. The location of this threshold depended on CUE scenario, with higher temperature thresholds under the acclimated and constant scenarios. This result suggests that the temperature sensitivity of CUE and the structure of the soil carbon model together regulate the long-term soil carbon response to warming. Equilibrium soil carbon stocks predicted by the microbial models were much less sensitive to changing inputs compared to the conventional model. Although many soil carbon dynamics were similar across microbial models, the most complex model showed less pronounced oscillations. Thus, adding model complexity (i.e. including enzyme pools) could improve the mechanistic representation of soil carbon dynamics during the transient phase in certain ecosystems. This study suggests that model structure and CUE parameterization should be carefully evaluated when scaling up microbial models to ecosystems and the globe.",Also listed in grant 919381,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We then investigated whether HYDREMATS could be effectively forced by satellite‐based estimates of rainfall instead of ground‐based observations. The Climate Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH) precipitation estimates distributed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are available at a 30 min temporal resolution and 8 km spatial resolution.

 We coupled a detailed mechanistic hydrology and entomology model with 
climate projections from general circulation models (GCMs) to predict 
changes in vectorial capacity, an indication of the risk of human 
malaria infections, resulting from changes in the availability of 
mosquito breeding sites and temperature-dependent development rates. 
Because there is strong disagreement in climate predictions from 
different GCMs, we focused on the GCM projections that produced the best
 and worst conditions for malaria transmission in each zone of the study
 area.Results: Simulation-based estimates suggest that in the 
desert fringes of the Sahara, vectorial capacity would increase under 
the worst-case scenario, but not enough to sustain transmission. In the 
transitional zone of the Sahel, climate change is predicted to decrease 
vectorial capacity. In the wetter regions to the south, our estimates 
suggest an increase in vectorial capacity under all scenarios. However, 
because malaria is already highly endemic among human populations in 
these regions, we expect that changes in malaria incidence would be 
small.Conclusion: Our findings highlight the importance of

 levels of relative humidity are known to decrease the lifespan of 
mosquitoes. However, most current models of malaria transmission do not 
account for the effects of relative humidity on mosquito survival. In 
the Sahel, where relative humidity drops to levels <20% for several 
months of the year, we expect relative humidity to play a significant 
role in shaping the seasonal profile of mosquito populations. Here, we 
present a new formulation for Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.)

 existing observations on relationships between temperature, relative

 humidity drops to levels that are uncomfortable for mosquitoes at the

up and interrupted mosquito breeding shortly after the end of the rainy

mosquito population. However, in the other village, Zindarou, the 
relatively shallow water table led to water pools that persisted several
 months beyond the end of the rainy season. In this case, the decrease 
in mosquito survival due to relative humidity improved the model’s

abundance.ConclusionsWe proposed a new equation to describe Anopheles gambiae s.l.

 of the concerns for future malaria epidemiology is the elevated risks 
of malaria around an ever-increasing number of dam sites. Controlling 
larval populations around reservoirs behind dams by manipulating the 
water levels of reservoirs could be an effective and sustainable measure
 for suppressing malaria epidemics; however, the effectiveness of the 
water-level manipulation and the contributing mechanisms have been 
poorly studied. In this paper, we focus on how water recession may lead 
to larval stranding.MethodsLarvae of An. albimanus
 were studied to assess their susceptibility to stranding under 
different conditions representing reservoir shoreline environments in an
 experimental tank (50 cm × 100 cm). The tank was initially seeded with 
80 larvae uniformly, and the numbers of larvae stranded on land and 
remaining in water were counted (summed up to recovered larvae), 
following the recession of water. The vertical water drawdown rate and 
the proportion of stranded larvae to recovered larvae (p) were 
measured. Shoreline conditions tested were inclinations of shore slopes 
(2% and 4%) and surface types (smooth, vegetated, rough, ridged).ResultsFor the 2% slopes, the proportions of stranded larvae (p)
 increased by about 0.002, 0.004, and 0.010 as the water drawdown rate 
increased by a centimeter per day on the smooth, rough, and vegetated 
surfaces, respectively. p for the 4% slopes were smaller than for the 2% slopes. Unlike other surface conditions, no significant correlation between p and the drawdown rate was observed on the ridged surface.ConclusionsLarger proportions of Anopheles
 larvae were stranded at higher water drawdown rates, on smaller 
reservoir slopes, and under rough or vegetated surface conditions. Three
 mechanisms of larval stranding were identified: falling behind 
shoreline recession; entrapment in small closed water bodies; and 
inhabitation in shallow areas. Depending on the local vectors of Anopheles
 mosquitoes, the conditions for their favorable breeding sites 
correspond to the conditions for large larval stranding. If these 
conditions are met, water-level manipulation could be an effective 
measure to control malaria along shorelines of reservoirs behind dams.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

immunity that protects from severe disease and high levels of 
parasitization. Acquired immunity has been incorporated into numerous 
models of malaria transmission of varying levels of complexity (e.g. 
Bull World Health Organ 50:347, 1974; Am J Trop Med Hyg 75:19, 2006; 
Math Biosci 90:385–396, 1988). Most such models require prescribing 
inputs of mosquito biting rates or other entomological or 
epidemiological information. Here, we present a model with a novel 
structure that uses environmental controls of mosquito population 
dynamics to simulate the mosquito biting rates, malaria prevalence as 
well as variability in protective immunity of the population.MethodsA
 simple model of acquired immunity to malaria is presented and tested 
within the framework of the Hydrology, Entomology and Malaria 
Transmission Simulator (HYDREMATS), a coupled hydrology and agent-based 
entomology model. The combined model uses environmental data including 
rainfall, temperature, and topography to simulate malaria prevalence and
 level of acquired immunity in the human population. The model is used 
to demonstrate the effect of acquired immunity on malaria prevalence in 
two Niger villages that are hydrologically and entomologically very 
different. Simulations are conducted for the year 2006 and compared to 
malaria prevalence observations collected from the two villages.ResultsBlood
 smear samples from children show no clear difference in malaria 
prevalence between the two villages despite pronounced differences in 
observed mosquito abundance. The similarity in prevalence is attributed 
to the moderating effect of acquired immunity, which depends on prior 
exposure to the parasite through infectious bites - and thus the 
hydrologically determined mosquito abundance. Modelling the level of 
acquired immunity can affect village vulnerability to climatic 
anomalies.ConclusionsThe
 model presented has a novel structure constituting a mechanistic link 
between spatial and temporal environmental variability and village-scale
 malaria transmission. Incorporating acquired immunity into the model 
has allowed simulation of prevalence in the two villages, and isolation 
of the effects of acquired immunity in dampening the difference in 
prevalence between the two villages. Without these effects, the 
difference in prevalence between the two villages would have been 
significantly larger in response to the large differences in mosquito 
populations and the associated biting rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Minor.",Biological Invasions,2,2,3,29,22Apr20,"The spread and distribution of exotic species depends on a number of factors, both anthropogenic and biophysical. The importance of each factor may vary geographically, making it difficult to predict where a species will spread. In this paper, we examine the factors that influence the distribution of monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus), a parrot native to South America that has become established in the United States. We use monk parakeet observations gathered from citizen-science datasets to inform a series of random forest models that examine the relative importance of biophysical and anthropogenic variables in different regions of the United States. We find that while the distribution of monk parakeets in the southern US is best explained by biophysical variables such as January dew point temperature and forest cover, the distribution of monk parakeets in the northern US appears to be limited to urban environments. Our results suggest that monk parakeets are unlikely to spread outside of urban environments in the northern United States, as they are not adapted to the climatic conditions in that region. We extend the notion of “substitutable habitats,” previously applied to different habitats in the same landscape, to exotic species in novel landscapes (e.g., cities). These novel landscapes provide resources and environmental conditions that, although very different from the species’ native habitat, still enable them to become established. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the regionally-specific factors that allow an exotic species to become established, which is key to predicting their expansion beyond areas of introduction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We then used the LIDAR-derived metrics to predict acoustic diversity across the forest landscape. Sound recordings were obtained from 14 sites for six consecutive days during dusk chorus (6 pm). Acoustic diversity was calculated for each day as the total intensity across acoustic frequency bands using the Shannon index and then averaged over the 6 days at each site. A 10 m radius around each site was used to obtain several LIDAR-derived metrics describing the vertical structural attributes of the forest canopy. Multiple linear regression (MLR) with Akaike information criterion was used to determine a top-ranked model with acoustic diversity as the dependent variable and the LIDAR metrics as independent variables. Acoustic diversity was modeled for forested areas (where canopy height was >20 m) at 20 m resolution using coefficients obtained from the MLR, and a hotspot analysis was conducted on the resulting layer. Acoustic diversity was strongly correlated (R 2 = 0.75) with the LIDAR metrics suggesting that LIDAR-derived metrics can be used to determine canopy structural attributes important to vocal fauna species. The hotspot analysis revealed that the spatial distribution of these canopy structural attributes across the La Selva forest is not random. Our approach can be used to identify forest patches of potentially high acoustic diversity for conservation or management purposes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study analyzed whether vacant lots are suitable for food production, by comparing the soil nematode food webs and nutrient pools of vacant lots and community gardens in two post-industrial U.S. cities, Akron and Cleveland, Ohio. Twelve vacant lots and 12 community gardens were examined in the two cities. All six Akron community gardens were established just prior to the initiation of this study, whereas the six in Cleveland were 15–30 years old. Soil pH, texture, moisture, organic matter, mineral nitrogen content, microbial biomass, and nematode communities were measured in both cities. Soil decomposition rate was also measured in Cleveland. Results show that the soils of vacant lots surpassed those of the newly-established Akron gardens and were equal to the soils of the well-established Cleveland gardens in the amount of ammonium-nitrogen, total nematode population, genus diversity, and maturity and structure indices. The soils of the vacant lots were lower than the community gardens in the amounts of soil moisture, organic matter, and nitrate-nitrogen, which we associate with the addition of water, compost, fertilizer, and tilling in the gardens. No significant difference was found between community gardens and vacant lots in microbial biomass, decomposition rate, or nematode enrichment index, which seems to indicate that vacant lots are equal to community gardens in nutrient availability and nutrient cycling. We conclude that barring any contamination, the soil in vacant lots maybe suitable for the establishment of food gardens, which can provide many desirable ecosystem services and enhance human well-being. We also find that the disturbance associated with tillage and conversion of a vacant lot into a community garden has short-term ramifications for both nematode food webs and mineral-nitrogen content.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Urban boundaries from 1920’s (old), 1960’s (middle) and 2000’s (new) were identified for three cities in northeast Ohio: Massillon, Wooster and Canton. Within each identified historic boundary, soil samples were collected from two road-side and two interior lawns in one public school site in each city. Thus, there were three urban age and two distance-to-roads classes. Soil particle composition and basic chemical properties including pH, available phosphorus (P), exchangeable potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), cation exchange capacity (CEC), nitrate, total carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), and soil organic matter (SOM) were measured. Two notable spatio-temporal patterns appeared repeatedly in the data set. First, total C, total N and SOM were higher in the soils of old (>50 years) urban sites than of newly developed sites. Similar, but not always significant, trends in soil pH, and exchangeable Ca were also observed. Second, road-side soils had higher pH, Ca, total C and N than interior sites regardless of urban age.

However, urban agriculture must rely on the supporting and regulating services of the soil food web. Hence, we quantified belowground biocontrol activity in urban gardens and vacant lots in two post-industrial cities using an in situ insect baiting technique. Due to the differences in habitat structure, we hypothesized that belowground biocontrol services will differ between gardens and vacant lots and the influence of habitat structure would differ with the type of biocontrol organism. Results revealed that biocontrol activity, as assessed by % mortality of baited insects, varied between 51% and 98% with higher activity often recorded in vacant lots than gardens. Major contributions to bait insect mortality were by ants, followed by microbial pathogens and entomopathogenic nematodes, respectively. Ants showed higher (p < 0.0001) % mortality in vacant lots (60% ± 33.4%) than in urban gardens (33.3% ± 22.2%) whereas microbial pathogens exhibited higher (p < 0.0001) mortality in gardens (27.8% ± 15%) than vacant lots (8.3% ± 16.7%). Ants caused higher (p < 0.0001) mortality when larger-mesh size cages were used compared with the smaller-mesh size cages, but mortality by microbial pathogens did not differ with cage type.

 at the prevailing growth temperature declined steadily throughout the 
growing season despite higher temperatures at the end of the summer. 
Differences in R were associated with changes in the relative

As a result, green roofs are being increasingly implemented as part of urban stormwater management plans in cities around the world. In this study, three full-scale green roofs in New York City (NYC) were monitored, representing the three extensive green roof types most commonly constructed: (1) a vegetated mat system installed on a Columbia University residential building, referred to as W118; (2) a built-in-place system installed on the United States Postal Service (USPS) Morgan general mail facility; and (3) a modular tray system installed on the ConEdison (ConEd) Learning Center. Continuous rainfall and runoff data were collected from each green roof between June 2011 and June 2012, resulting in 243 storm events suitable for analysis ranging from 0.25 to 180 mm in depth. Over the monitoring period the W118, USPS, and ConEd roofs retained 36%, 47%, and 61% of the total rainfall respectively. Rainfall attenuation of individual storm events ranged from 3 to 100% for W118, 9 to 100% for USPS, and 20 to 100% for ConEd, where, generally, as total rainfall increased the per cent of rainfall attenuation decreased. Seasonal retention behavior also displayed event size dependence. For events of 10–40 mm rainfall depth, median retention was highest in the summer and lowest in the winter, whereas median retention for events of 0–10 mm and 40 +mm rainfall depth did not conform to this expectation. Given the significant influence of event size on attenuation, the total per cent retention during a given monitoring period might not be indicative of annual rooftop retention if the distribution of observed event sizes varies from characteristic annual rainfall. To account for this, the 12 months of monitoring data were used to develop a characteristic runoff equation (CRE), relating runoff depth and event size, for each green roof. When applied to Central Park, NYC precipitation records from 1971 to 2010, the CRE models estimated total rainfall retention over the 40 year period to be 45%, 53%, and 58% for the W118, USPS, and ConEd green roofs respectively. Differences between the observed and modeled rainfall retention for W118 and USPS were primarily due to an abnormally high frequency of large events, 50 mm of rainfall or more, during the monitoring period compared to historic precipitation patterns. The multi-year retention rates are a more reliable estimate of annual rainfall capture and highlight the importance of long-term evaluations when reporting green roof performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, nutrient cycling in urban ecosystems is difficult to predict, and nitrogen (N) use in urban trees may be quite different from use in rural forests. To gain insight into these biogeochemical and physiological processes, we compared foliar N characteristics of several common northeastern deciduous tree species across four newly planted New York City afforestation sites as well as at the Black Rock Forest (BRF), a rural oak-dominated forest in the Hudson Highlands, New York. Foliage sampled at BRF was consistently depleted in 15N compared to urban foliage, and Amelanchier canadensis, Nyssa sylvatica, Prunus serotina, and Quercus rubra showed significant variation in foliar nitrogen isotope signatures (δ15N) among the four urban sites. A. canadensis and P. serotina showed significantly greater ability to assimilate nitrate at BRF compared to urban sites, as measured through nitrate reductase activity (NRA). There were no significant differences in NRA among tree species growing at the four urban sites. Only P. serotina and N. sylvatica showed significant variation in foliar N concentrations (%N) both among urban sites and compared to BRF. The isotopic and %N data suggest greater N availability but less available nitrate at the newly planted urban sites compared to BRF, possibly due to different anthropogenic inputs or higher rates of nitrification and nitrate leaching at the recently planted urban sites compared to likely lower rates of N cycling in the intact rural forest. In addition, the tree species varied in their response to N availability at the urban sites, with potential implications for growth and survival. Understanding N cycling in urban systems and the associated physiological changes in vegetation is critical to a comprehensive evaluation of urban forest restoration, and may have implications for carbon sequestration and water quality issues associated with nitrate export, two important areas of management concern.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Urban environments exhibit several factors affecting plant growth and function, including high temperatures (particularly at night), CO2 concentrations and atmospheric nitrogen deposition. We investigated the effects of urban environments on growth in Quercus rubra L. seedlings. We grew seedlings from acorns for one season at four sites along an urban–rural transect from Central Park in New York City to the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York (difference in average maximum temperatures of 2.4 °C; difference in minimum temperatures of 4.6 °C). In addition, we grew Q. rubra seedlings in growth cabinets (GCs) mimicking the seasonal differential between the city and rural sites (based on a 5-year average). In the field experiment, we found an eightfold increase in biomass in urban-grown seedlings relative to those grown at rural sites. This difference was primarily related to changes in growth allocation. Urban-grown seedlings and seedlings grown at urban temperatures in the GCs exhibited a lower root: shoot ratio (urban ∼0.8, rural/remote ∼1.5), reducing below-ground carbon costs associated with construction and maintenance. These urban seedlings instead allocated more growth to leaves than did rural-grown seedlings, resulting in 10-fold greater photosynthetic area but no difference in photosynthetic capacity of foliage per unit area. Seedlings grown at urban temperatures in both the field and GC experiments had higher leaf nitrogen concentrations per unit area than those grown at cooler temperatures (increases of 23% in field, 32% in GC). Lastly, we measured threefold greater 13C enrichment of respired CO2 (relative to substrate) in urban-grown leaves than at other sites, which may suggest greater allocation of respiratory function to growth over maintenance. It also shows that lack of differences in total R flux in response to environmental conditions may mask dramatic shifts in respiratory functioning. Overall, our findings indicating greater seedling growth and establishment at a critical regeneration phase of forest development may have important implications for the ecology of urban forests as well as the predicted growth of the terrestrial biosphere in temperate regions in response to climate change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explore the consequences of this coupling using a numerical model for large‐scale coastline evolution to compare the long‐term, non‐local effects of two generalized classes of shoreline stabilization: 1) beach nourishment (the addition of dredged sand to an eroding beach), and 2) hard‐structures (e.g., seawalls, groynes, etc.) which fix the position of the shoreline without adding sand. In centurial model experiments where localized stabilization is maintained in the context of changing climate forcing, both forms of stabilization are found to significantly alter patterns of erosion and accretion at distances up to tens of kilometers. On a cuspate‐cape coastline similar to the North and South Carolina coast, USA, with stabilization applied to the eroding updrift flank of a single cape, perturbations to coastline evolution are qualitatively similar within ∼20 km for each stabilization scenario, though they differ in magnitude both updrift and downdrift of the stabilized shoreline. The “human” signal in coastline change can extend as far as a neighboring cape (approximately 100 km away), but these long‐range effects differ for each scenario. Nourishment resulted in seaward growth of the stabilized cape, increasing the extent that it blocked sediment flux in downdrift regions of the coast through wave shadowing. When stabilized with a hard structure the cape's initial position remain fixed, decreasing wave shadowing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efforts linking physical and behavioural models to explore shoreline dynamics2,3,4 have not yet brought together this set of essential factors. We couple a barrier-island model with an agent-based model of real-estate markets5 to show that, relative to people with low belief in model predictions about climate change, informed property owners invest heavily in defensive expenditures in the near term and then abandon coastal real estate at some critical risk threshold that presages a period of significant price volatility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Beach nourishment"", a common erosion-control practice, involves mechanically depositing sediment from outside the local littoral system onto an actively eroding shoreline to alter shoreline morphology. Natural sediment-transport processes quickly rework the newly engineered beach, causing further changes to the shoreline that in turn affect subsequent beach-nourishment decisions. To the limited extent that this landscape/economic coupling has been considered, evidence suggests that towns tend to employ spatially myopic economic strategies under which individual towns make isolated decisions that do not account for their neighbors. What happens when an optimization strategy that explicitly ignores spatial interactions is incorporated into a physical model that is spatially dynamic? The long-term attractor that develops for the coupled system (the state and behavior to which the system evolves over time) is unclear. We link an economic model, in which town-manager agents choose economically optimal beach-nourishment intervals according to past observations of their immediate shoreline, to a simplified coastal-dynamics model that includes alongshore sediment transport and background erosion (e.g. from sea-level rise). Simulations suggest that feedbacks between these human and natural coastal processes can generate emergent behaviors. When alongshore sediment transport and spatially myopic nourishment decisions are coupled, increases in the rate of sea-level rise can destabilize economically optimal nourishment practices into a regime characterized by the emergence of chaotic shoreline evolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rising sea level will enhance shoreline erosion, and recent work indicates changing storm patterns and associated changes in wave conditions can intensify coastal erosion along parts of a coastline. Investigations of coastal response to climate change typically consider natural processes in isolation — neglecting repeated changes to the coastline from human actions, primarily through shoreline nourishment projects, which add sand to the shoreline to counteract erosion. In a model coupling economically driven shoreline nourishment with wave‐ and sea level rise‐driven coastline change, and accounting for dwindling sediment resources for nourishment, coastline response depends dramatically on the relationship between patterns of property value and erosion. Simulations show that when nourishment costs rise with depletion of sand resources, coastline change is tied to the interaction between patterns of erosion and property value. Simulations show that when high property values align with highly erosive locations, sand resources are depleted rapidly and nourishment in lower property value towns is quickly abandoned. Although our model simulates a particular coastal morphology, the result that future behavior of the coastline and the economic viability of nourishment in a given town depend on the regional interaction between patterns of property value and erosion is likely applicable to many coastal configurations. More broadly, coupling economic and physical models reveals equity and sustainability implications of coastal climate adaptation as well as patterns of coastline change that a physical model alone would overlook.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grant.3109053,952120,Progress in Coupling Models of Human and Coastal Landscape Change,2013,Murray et al. ,Computers and Geosciences,1,1,1,33,16Apr2020,"Humans are increasingly altering the Earth's surface, and affecting processes that shape and reshape landscapes. In many cases, humans are reacting to landscape-change processes that represent natural hazards. Thus, the landscape is reacting to humans who are reacting to the landscape. When the timescales for landscape change are comparable to those of human dynamics, human and ‘natural’ components of developed environments are dynamically coupled—necessitating coupling models of human and physical/biological processes to study either environmental change or human responses. Here we focus on a case study coupling models of coastal economics and physical coastline change. In this modeling, coastline change results from patterns of wave-driven sediment transport and sea-level rise, and shoreline stabilization decisions are based on the benefits of wide beaches (capitalized into property values) balanced against the costs of stabilization. This interdisciplinary modeling highlights points that may apply to other coupled human/natural systems. First, climate change, by accelerating the rates of landscape change, tends to strengthen the coupling with human dynamics. In our case study, both increasing sea-level-rise rates and changing storm patterns tend to increase shoreline change rates, which can induce more vigorous shoreline stabilization efforts. However, property values can fall dramatically as erosion rates and stabilization costs rise, which can also lead to the abandonment of expensive stabilization methods as shoreline change rates increase. Second, socio-economic change can also strengthen the human/landscape coupling. Changing costs of shoreline stabilization can alter stabilization decisions, which in turn alters patterns of coastline change. The coupled modeling illuminates the long-range effects of localized shoreline stabilization efforts; communities arrayed along a coastline are unwittingly affecting each other's erosion rates, and therefore each other's economies. Our coupled modeling experiments show that spatial distributions of property values and erosion rates can jointly affect economic outcomes, resource allocation between communities, and patterns of shoreline change. These findings raise questions about coastal management strategies, and efficient and equitable allocation of scarce resources among coastal communities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Humans often respond to shoreline erosion with beach nourishment to maintain coastal property values. Locally extending the shoreline through nourishment alters alongshore sediment transport and changes shoreline dynamics in adjacent coastal regions. If left unmanaged, sandy coastlines can have spatially complex or simple patterns of erosion due to the relationship of large‐scale morphology and the local wave climate. Using a numerical model that simulates spatially decentralized and locally optimal nourishment decisions characteristic of much of U.S. East Coast beach management, we find that human erosion intervention does not simply reflect the alongshore erosion pattern. Spatial interactions generate feedbacks in economic and physical variables that lead to widespread emergence of “free riders” and “suckers” with subsequent inequality in the alongshore distribution of property value. Along cuspate coastlines, such as those found along the U.S. Southeast Coast, these long‐term property value differences span an order of magnitude. Results imply that spatially decentralized management of nourishment can lead to property values that are divorced from spatial erosion signals; this management approach is unlikely to be optimal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet environmental stress and adaptive capacity are distributed unevenly, and power structures play a role in fashioning them. It is argued here that when access to land and water are impacted by environmental stress, the structures that mediate their access are reinforced, even as the adaptive alternatives for smallholders are undermined. In this way, dominant resource regimes set up migration as the primary viable alternative for adaptation among a dwindling set of choices. This framework is applied to two early analogues of climate change impacts: flooded Garífuna villages of Honduras's North Coast and communities enduring glacier recession and shifting hydrologic regimes in Peru's Cordillera Blanca. In both cases, stress motivates new forms of migration that reinforce dominant power structures. In Honduras, migrants from wealthier social strata are moving on a more permanent basis, and in Peru, the once historical pattern of labor migration is becoming a practical necessity. These cases underscore the role of political economy in adaptation to climate change and adaptive migration in particular.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

To understand, model, and adapt to these climate-glacier-water changes, it is vital to integrate the analysis of both water availability (the domain of hydrologists) and water use (the focus for social scientists). Drawn from a case study of the Santa River watershed below Peru’s glaciated Cordillera Blanca mountain range, this paper provides a holistic hydro-social framework that identifies five major human variables critical to hydrological modeling because these forces have profoundly influenced water use over the last 60 years: (1) political agendas and economic development; (2) governance: laws and institutions; (3) technology and engineering; (4) land and resource use; and (5) societal responses. Notable shifts in Santa River water use—including major expansions in hydroelectricity generation, large-scale irrigation projects, and other land and resource-use practices—did not necessarily stem from changing glacier runoff or hydrologic shifts, but rather from these human variables. Ultimately, then, water usage is not predictable based on water availability alone. Glacier runoff conforms to certain expected trends predicted by models of progressively reduced glacier storage. However, societal forces establish the legal, economic, political, cultural, and social drivers that actually shape water usage patterns via human modification of watershed dynamics. This hydro-social framework has widespread implications for hydrological modeling in glaciated watersheds from the Andes and Alps to the Himalaya and Tien Shan, as well as for the development of climate change adaptation plans.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Our synthesis reveals heterogeneous—sometimes unexpected—responses to land change. For example, in contrast with temperate highlands, forest-to-grassland conversion in the high-elevation tropics often results in little runoff increase and lower streamwater nitrate loss. Tree plantation establishment leads to diminished runoff; the magnitude of this effect is tenfold greater than with forest-to-grassland transitions. We highlight cases in which land use, land cover, and water relationships derived from temperate ecosystems do not apply to and, therefore, should not underpin watershed management programs in the high-elevation tropics.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Although water modeling research has begun to examine changing environmental parameters, the inclusion of social scenarios has been very limited. Yet human water use and demand are vital for long-term adaptation, risk reduction, and resource allocation. Concerns about future water supplies are particularly pronounced on Peru's arid Pacific slope, where upstream glacier recession has been accompanied by rapid and water-intensive economic development. Models predict water shortages decades into the future, but conflicts have already arisen in Peru's Santa River watershed due to either real or perceived shortages. Modeled thresholds do not align well with historical realities and therefore suggest that a broader analysis of the combined natural and social drivers of change is needed to more effectively understand the hydrologic transformation taking place across the watershed. This article situates these new geographies of water and climate change in Peru within current global change research discussions to demonstrate how future coupled research models can inform broader scale questions of hydrologic change and water security across watersheds and regions. We provide a coupled historical analysis of glacier recession in the Cordillera Blanca, declining Santa River discharge, and alpine wetland contraction. We also examine various water withdrawal mechanisms, including smallholder agriculture, mining, potable water use, hydroelectric power generation, and coastal irrigation.

Results are interpreted using synthetic time series generated from a hydrologic model that calculates hydrographs based on glacier retreat sequences. The results suggest that seven of the nine study watersheds have probably crossed a critical transition point, and now exhibit decreasing dry-season discharge.

Water flows are rarely quantified, and unanticipated results are common, suggesting land cover alone is not a reliable proxy for water services. We argue that managing key hydrologic fluxes at the site of intervention is more effective than promoting particular land-cover types. Moving beyond land cover proxies to a focus on hydrologic fluxes requires that programs (1) identify the specific water service of interest and associated hydrologic flux; (2) account for structural and ecological characteristics of the relevant land cover; and, (3) determine key mediators of the target hydrologic flux. Using examples from the tropics, we illustrate how this conceptual framework can clarify interventions with a higher probability of delivering desired water services than with land cover as a proxy.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Although groundwater is a critical hydrologic component that sustains stream flows during the dry season, its characteristics and its contribution to downstream hydrology remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyse the hydrochemical and isotopic properties of potential hydrologic sources mixing in surface streams to characterize the proglacial hydrology in four glacially fed watersheds within the Cordillera Blanca, Peru. Water samples from streams, glacial melt and groundwater were collected in 2008 and 2009 and analysed for major ions and stable isotopes (δ18O and δ2H). Multivariate analysis of variance was used first to identify the hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics (tracers) of the water samples that depend primarily on the water source. Then several analyses, including hierarchical cluster analysis and mixing diagrams, were performed using these source‐dependent tracers, enabling a qualitative description of the key hydrological mechanisms that characterize the study watersheds. Finally, we applied a multi‐component spatial mixing model, the hydrochemical basin characterization method, to quantify the contributions of different water sources to the outflow from the four watersheds. The hydrochemical basin characterization method results show that groundwater is a major component of the discharge during the dry season and that the groundwater contribution to outflow is greater than 24% in all of the valleys. The results are used to develop a conceptual proglacial hydrological model of the Cordillera Blanca valleys. Talus and avalanche cones are identified as key components of the hydrology of the valleys. The talus deposits collect precipitation and runoff from higher elevations (approximately 400 m above the valley floor) and have a residence time that is long enough to actively release substantial volumes of water throughout the dry season.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The behaviors of such groups are shaped by their diverse motivations and circumstances. Segmenting heterogeneous target groups into more homogeneous subgroups may improve the chances of successfully identifying policy strategies to influence their behavior. Findings from a multimethod study of nonindustrial private forest owners in eastern Oregon suggest four unique subgroups of owners with different fuel management motivations and suitabilities for policy tools: commodity managers could benefit from market-based incentives; amenity managers could benefit from capacity building programs paired with symbolic campaigns; recreational managers could benefit from public incentives provided through consultants or contractors who can help plan the work; and passive managers may benefit from opportunities to respond to the policy strategies designed for the other groupings until more information can be gathered.

We tested our conceptual framework using probit analysis of empirical data from a survey of non-industrial private forest landowners in the ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) region of eastern Oregon (USA). Our empirical results confirm the conceptual framework and suggest that landowners’ perceptions of wildfire risk and propensity to conduct fuel treatments are correlated with hazardous fuel conditions on or near their parcels, whether they have housing or timber assets at risk, and their past experience with wildfire, financial capacity for conducting treatments and membership in forestry and fire protection organisations.

In this investigation, we apply a distributed hydrologic model to the Beaver Creek watershed of central Arizona to explore its utility for climate change assessments. Manual model calibration and model validation were performed using radar-based precipitation data during three summers and compared to two alternative meteorological products to illustrate the sensitivity of the streamflow response. Using the calibrated and validated model, we investigated the watershed response during historical (1990–2000) and future (2031–2040) summer projections derived from a single realization of a mesoscale model forced with boundary conditions from a general circulation model under a high emissions scenario. Results indicate spatially-averaged changes across the two projections: an increase in air temperature of 1.2 °C, a 2.4-fold increase in precipitation amount and a 3-fold increase in variability, and a 3.1-fold increase in streamflow amount and a 5.1-fold increase in variability. Nevertheless, relatively minor changes were obtained in spatially-averaged evapotranspiration. To explain this, we used the simulated hydroclimatological mechanisms to identify that higher precipitation limits radiation through cloud cover leading to lower evapotranspiration in regions with orographic effects. This challenges conventional wisdom on evapotranspiration trends and suggest that a more nuanced approach is needed to communicate hydrologic vulnerability to stakeholders and decision-makers in this semiarid region.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

This study combines a set of previously developed modeling approaches to create a synthetic flood event during which bed sediment is entrained and deposited as a function of hydraulic conditions and particle size. One simulated river reach in a state of approximate dynamic equilibrium is chosen to investigate the impacts of size-selective sediment transport on stream-aquifer interaction. Along this reach, the preferential entrainment of fine sediment during the flood's rising limb leads to overall bed coarsening, and increases in vertical hydraulic conductivity (K bv) and downward fluxes of floodwater into the streambed. Progressively finer sediment layers are deposited during the event's falling limb, causing the redevelopment of a colmation (clogging) layer on the bed surface and a decline in overall K bv by the event's conclusion. This reduction in K bv leads to prolonged retention of event water in the streambed (after the reach reverts from losing to gaining river conditions) when compared with what is expected if pre-event K bv values are used to estimate river-aquifer exchanges. This process of sequential bed coarsening and fining during a flood event provides a mechanistic explanation for the event size-and-duration threshold, inferred in some systems, that must be exceeded for significant amounts of flood recharge to occur. The major consequences of these processesenhanced infiltration and prolonged floodwater retentionhave potentially major implications for groundwater-surface water interactions, water quality, contaminant transport, and riparian biogeochemistry.

Here the impact of flood size and duration was investigated. Flood-driven recharge along predominantly losing reaches of the Bill Williams River (western Arizona, USA) later reemerges as baseflow in downstream gaining reaches, and the river’s longest losing reach (Planet Valley) retains and releases the most flood recharge. River discharge volume and flow intermittency downstream of Planet Valley is highly dependent upon the length of time since the last major flood. After large floods (e.g. 2004–2005), baseflow was dominated by the flood’s chemical (SO4, Cl) and isotopic (δ18OH2O, δ2HH2O, δ34SSO4, δ18OSO4) composition for long periods (>4 years), suggesting that the largest events result in much more flood recharge and a longer persistence of floodwater in the subsurface than after smaller, more recent events. The continued dominance of baseflow by 2004–2005 floodwater nearly 5 years later—despite three smaller floods in 2007, 2008 and 2009—highlights the long-term impacts that the largest floods have on riparian water composition. Of these three recent events, only the largest and longest (in 2009) caused observable changes in both baseflow volume and the composition of baseflow and riparian groundwater, thereby suggesting that a threshold of flood size and duration exists for floods to alter the system’s state and behavior. The river’s dependence on large winter floods and the tendency of a particular set of atmospheric conditions (associated with El Niño-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO) to cause the region’s largest winter floods indicates the importance of ENSO to the system, and that future changes to ENSO caused by climate change could drasti","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

The aquifer response to flood events can affect the geochemical composition of both near‐stream groundwater and post‐event streamflow, but the amount and persistence of recharged floodwater may differ as a function of local hydrogeologic forcings. As a result, this study focuses on how vertical flood recharge varies under different hydrogeologic forcings and the significance that recharge processes can have on groundwater and streamflow composition after floods.

River and shallow groundwater samples were collected along three reaches of the Upper San Pedro River (Arizona, USA) before, during and after the 2009 and 2010 summer monsoon seasons. Tracer data from these samples indicate that subsurface floodwater propagation and residence times are strongly controlled by the direction and magnitude of the dominant stream–aquifer gradient. A reach that is typically strongly gaining shows minimal floodwater retention shortly after large events, whereas the moderately gaining and losing reaches can retain recharged floodwater from smaller events for longer periods. The moderately gaining reach likely returned flood recharge to the river as flow declined. These results indicate that reach‐scale differences in hydrogeologic forcing can control (i) the amount of local flood recharge during events and (ii) the duration of its subsurface retention and possible return to the stream during low‐flow periods. Our observations also suggest that the presence of floodwater in year‐round baseflow is not due to long‐term storage beneath the streambed along predominantly gaining reaches, so three alternative mechanisms are suggested: (i) repeated flooding that drives lateral redistribution of previously recharged floodwater, (ii) vertical recharge on the floodplain during overbank flow events and (iii) temporal variability in the stream–aquifer gradient due to seasonally varying water demands of riparian vegetation.

However, the fine grid has a larger positive bias in mean summer precipitation than the coarse‐resolution grid.

Assessing the impact of LULC and climate changes on streamflow is typically done with a calibrated and validated watershed model. However, there is a debate on the degree of calibration required. The objective of this study was to quantify the variation in estimated relative and absolute changes in streamflow associated with LULC and climate changes with different calibration approaches. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied in an uncalibrated (UC), single outlet calibrated (OC), and spatially-calibrated (SC) mode to compare the relative and absolute changes in streamflow at 14 gaging stations within the Santa Cruz River Watershed in southern Arizona, USA. For this purpose, the effect of 3 LULC, 3 precipitation (P), and 3 temperature (T) scenarios were tested individually. For the validation period, Percent Bias (PBIAS) values were >100% with the UC model for all gages, the values were between 0% and 100% with the OC model and within 20% with the SC model. Changes in streamflow predicted with the UC and OC models were compared with those of the SC model. This approach implicitly assumes that the SC model is “ideal”. Results indicated that the magnitude of both absolute and relative changes in streamflow due to LULC predicted with the UC and OC results were different than those of the SC model. The magnitude of absolute changes predicted with the UC and SC models due to climate change (both P and T) were also significantly different, but were not different for OC and SC models. Results clearly indicated that relative changes due to climate change predicted with the UC and OC were not significantly different than that predicted with the SC models. This result suggests that it is important to calibrate the model spatially to analyze the effect of LULC change but not as important for analyzing the relative change in streamflow due to climate change. This study also indicated that model calibration in not necessary to determine the direction of change in streamflow due to LULC and climate change.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Future greenhouse gas emissions follow the A2 emission scenario from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report simulations. We find that there is a consistent and clear intensification of the AR-related water vapor transport in both the global and regional simulations which reflects the increase in water vapor content due to warmer atmospheric temperatures, according to the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. However, the response of AR-related precipitation intensity to increased moisture flux and column-integrated water vapor is weak and no significant changes are projected either by the GCMs or the NARCCAP models. This lack of robust precipitation variations can be explained in part by the absence of meaningful changes in both the large-scale water vapor flux convergence and the maximum positive relative vorticity in the GCMs. Additionally, some global models show a robust decrease in relative humidity which may also be responsible for the projected precipitation patterns.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Therefore, the flood magnitude and frequency curve will not change with the inclusion of projected future climate data for the study watershed.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Broadbent et al. ,The Social Science Journal,2,3,3,0,19Mar20,"Stated preference methods have been used to value non-market public goods but questions remain about their incentive compatibility. A public goods referendum has proven to be incentive compatible for the more popular contingent valuation method. For attribute based choices, the choice experimental method values goods and services by attribute levels producing marginal values for the economic good. A referendum procedure has been proposed for this attribute based method but it is unclear how its use impacts participant choices. This research develops a controlled laboratory experiment eliciting individual and group responses for two non-market public goods using a referendum format for attribute based choice experiments. Results of the experiments find that a majority referendum rule induces individuals to form responses based upon group perceptions which may lead to non-truthful preference revelation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The water is also important for the health of riparian ecosystems in the Rio Grande basin. Historic groundwater pumping has resulted in large groundwater level drawdown, water quality deterioration, depletion of surface water and subsidence in El Paso/Ciudad Juarez area, which in turn will limit groundwater availability in the future. Therefore, securing future groundwater availability involves a multi‐spectrum of efforts, including minimizing net losses from the underground reservoir, managing groundwater as an integrated part of the hydrologic cycle, developing infrastructure based on an understanding of the natural hydrologic system, using water wisely and efficiently, and allocating and monitoring water fairly for human as well as environmental and ecological needs. This paper focuses on the current status of groundwater quantity and geochemistry—groundwater hydrology, key aquifers, water quantity and chemistry, impacts of groundwater pumping and climate variability on groundwater availability within the Rio Grande Basin along river reaches between Elephant Butte Dam and Amistad Dam. This paper is part of a larger effort to summarize the state of the science relative to water sustainability in the region. This information can be used to plan research and education agendas aimed at water sustainability under climate and social changes. Current water uses and estimates of groundwater availability are summarized for the selected regional aquifers that underlie or are located adjacent to the Rio Grande. Several research topics are identified and recommended in terms of gaining better understanding of groundwater availability and impacts of future groundwater pumping and climate variability on the regional aquifer systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this paper we modified a driver‐response conceptual model of social‐ecological interactions by considering the degree to which each binary set of processes (human or physical) is simultaneously a driver and a response to global change. Processes that we understood to be mutually conditioned offered greater potential compared to solely social or ecological communities to adapt to demographic and economic change, on the one hand, and to climate, water resources, and ecosystems dynamics, on the other. By considering case material from the United States–Mexico border region, we characterized social‐ecological interactions along a continuum from those acting exclusively as drivers to others reacting to change primarily as responses. We considered water resources to integrate multiple global change processes including climate change and variability, ecosystem resilience, and human water demands for a variety of purposes. Thus, we examined in detail two watersheds in the Arizona–Sonora borderlands representing mutually conditioned social‐ecological systems. First, the Río Magdalena in Sonora represented an illustrative case of smallholder agriculture and rural livelihoods engaged in social‐ecological interaction that exhibited both driver and response elements centered on reflexive, low‐impact adaptive strategies. Second, in Ambos Nogales relying on the Santa Cruz River and its associated aquifers, urban growth, the equity of water access for human purposes, and environmental quality represented especially pressing challenges. Here, human impacts on ecosystems were the predominant drivers although there was growing concern for the medium‐ and longer‐term implications of climate change. Adaption planning in Ambos Nogales was centered on infrastructure‐based solutions including an inter‐basin water transfer connection with the Río Magdalena. Wastewater flows to riparian corridors posed a particular challenge for human‐environment interactions. Cross‐border collaboration represents an important opportunity for adaptation based on the mutually conditioned interactions presented here. We summarized the analysis of both cases by raising conceptual questions for further enquiry and for adaptation and planning that are generic for the borderlands and beyond.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To avert impending crises in water scarcity and food security many nations are reshaping the priorities, regimes, and praxis of fresh water resource management to explicitly recognize and address diverse human and ecological needs. A recent United Nations sponsored study documenting the linkages between water, cultural diversity, and global environmental change argues that a coupled bio/social systems approach to watershed management prioritizing biocultural health over other concerns is needed to achieve sustainability goals, address the complex and protracted conflicts that characterize river basin management, and halt biocultural degeneration.

The region is semiarid, located far from oceanic sources of evaporated water. Its latitudinal position near the descending branch of the global atmospheric Hadley circulation means that cold season precipitation totals are suppressed relative to the average latitude of the winter storm track to the north. Furthermore, tree ring histories of climate variability demonstrate that the region is prone to shifts in the storm track that lead to very pronounced decadal variations in precipitation, which are manifested regionally as swings between severe droughts and pluvial periods. The El Niño‐Southern Oscillation in tropical Pacific Ocean temperature forces shorter term (year‐to‐year) shifts in the storm track. The border region is strongly affected by ongoing and projected century‐scale climate change, probably derived in large part from human‐caused increases in greenhouse gases. There is a very strong regional warming trend in recent temperature data, continued into the future in greenhouse gas‐forced model simulations of climate change. The warming trend modifies natural drought/pluvial precipitation fluctuations by enhancing evaporative losses and decreasing snowpack in mountainous regions to the north. These changes lead to projections of significantly diminished stream flow and drier surface conditions, thereby shifting the regional climate system farther toward aridity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I maintain that both the physical works and the institutions of water management should be understood as infrastructures, and locate infrastructures within larger political and economic processes. Archaeological, historical and ethnographic literature on irrigation in the borderlands provides data about the evolution and functioning of small‐ and large‐scale infrastructures. Since European contact, water infrastructures have enabled different regimes of accumulation to grow, overlap and decline: mining; ranching; agriculture; urbanization and industry; and the service economy. This process continues into the twenty first century, and changes to infrastructures that respond to current issues of scarcity and conflict must be understood in relation to this material history. I argue that in the present conjuncture new infrastructures must be developed to confront unsustainability, and the management and knowledge of these must be decentralized, democratic, and collective.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grant.3118993,1039127,Key landscape ecology metrics for assessing climate change adaptation options: rate of change and patchiness of impacts,2013, López-Hoffman et al. ,Ecosphere,1,1,1,8,16Apr2020,"Under a changing climate, devising strategies to help stakeholders adapt to alterations to ecosystems and their services is of utmost importance. In western North America, diminished snowpack and river flows are causing relatively gradual, homogeneous (system‐wide) changes in ecosystems and services. In addition, increased climate variability is also accelerating the incidence of abrupt and patchy disturbances such as fires, floods and droughts. This paper posits that two key variables often considered in landscape ecology—the rate of change and the degree of patchiness of change—can aid in developing climate change adaptation strategies. We use two examples from the “borderland” region of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. In piñon‐juniper woodland die‐offs that occurred in the southwestern United States during the 2000s, ecosystem services suddenly crashed in some parts of the system while remaining unaffected in other locations. The precise timing and location of die‐offs was uncertain. On the other hand, slower, homogeneous change, such as the expected declines in water supply to the Colorado River delta, will likely impact the entire ecosystem, with ecosystem services everywhere in the delta subject to alteration, and all users likely exposed. The rapidity and spatial heterogeneity of faster, patchy climate change exemplified by tree die‐off suggests that decision‐makers and local stakeholders would be wise to operate under a Rawlsian “veil of ignorance,” and implement adaptation strategies that allow ecosystem service users to equitably share the risk of sudden loss of ecosystem services before actual ecosystem changes occur. On the other hand, in the case of slower, homogeneous, system‐wide impacts to ecosystem services as exemplified by the Colorado River delta, adaptation strategies can be implemented after the changes begin, but will require a fundamental rethinking of how ecosystems and services are used and valued. In sum, understanding how the rate of change and degree of patchiness of change will constrain adaptive options is a critical consideration in preparing for climate change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Key threats to water sustainability in the Middle Rio Grande River region include: (1) increasing salinization of surface and ground water, (2) increasing water demand from a growing population in the El Paso/Ciudad Juarez area on top of an already high base demand from irrigated agriculture, (3) water quality impacts from agricultural, municipal, and industrial discharges to the river, (4) changing regional climate that portends increased frequency and intensity of droughts interspersed with more intensive rainfall and flooding events, and (5) disparate water planning and management systems between different states in the U.S. and between the U.S. and Mexico. In addition to these challenges, there is an increasing demand from a significant regional population who is (and has been historically) underserved in terms of access to affordable potable water. To address these challenges to water resources sustainability, we have focused on: (1) the determinants of resilience and transformability in an ecological/social setting on an international border and how they can be measured and predicted; and (2) the drivers of change … what are they (climate, social, etc.) and how are they impacting the coupled human and natural dimensions of water sustainability on the border? To tackle these challenges, we propose a research agenda based on a complex systems approach that focuses on the linkages and feedbacks of the natural, built/managed, and social dimensions of the surface and groundwater budget of the region. The approach that we propose incorporates elements of systems analysis, complexity science, and the use of modeling tools such as scenario planning and back‐casting to link the quantitative with the qualitative. This approach is unique for our region, as are our bi‐national focus and our conceptualization of “water capital”. In particular, the concept of water capital provides the basis for a new interdisciplinary paradigm that integrates social, economic, and natural sectors within a systems framework in order to understand and characterize water resources sustainability. This proposed approach would not only provide a framework for water sustainability decision making for our bi‐national region at the local, state, and federal levels, but could serve as a model for similar border regions and/or international rivers in arid and semi‐arid regions in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Latin America.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hall",Water Resources Research,2,2,2,126,22April2020,"A paired catchment methodology was used with more than 3 years of data to test whether forests increase base flow in the dry season, despite reduced annual runoff caused by evapotranspiration (the “sponge‐effect hypothesis”), and whether forests reduce maximum runoff rates and totals during storms. The three study catchments were: a 142.3 ha old secondary forest, a 175.6 ha mosaic of mixed age forest, pasture, and subsistence agriculture, and a 35.9 ha actively grazed pasture subcatchment of the mosaic catchment. The two larger catchments are adjacent, with similar morphology, soils, underlying geology, and rainfall. Annual water balances, peak runoff rates, runoff efficiencies, and dry season recessions show significant differences. Dry season runoff from the forested catchment receded more slowly than from the mosaic and pasture catchments. The runoff rate from the forest catchment was 1–50% greater than that from the similarly sized mosaic catchment at the end of the dry season. This observation supports the sponge‐effect hypothesis. The pasture and mosaic catchment median runoff efficiencies were 2.7 and 1.8 times that of the forest catchment, respectively, and increased with total storm rainfall. Peak runoff rates from the pasture and mosaic catchments were 1.7 and 1.4 times those of the forest catchment, respectively. The forest catchment produced 35% less total runoff and smaller peak runoff rates during the flood of record in the Panama Canal Watershed. Flood peak reduction and increased streamflows through dry periods are important benefits relevant to watershed management, payment for ecosystem services, water‐quality management, reservoir sedimentation, and fresh water security in the Panama Canal watershed and similar tropical landscapes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B., Ogden, F. L., Lyons, W. B.",Applied Geochemistry,3,3,3,15,22April2020,"Stream hydrograph separation using naturally occurring geochemical tracers holds great potential for elucidating mineral weathering and solute transport. This study addresses a critical need to characterize catchment runoff generation in the humid tropics using multiple natural tracers for hydrograph separation and concentration/discharge (C/Q) hysteresis analysis. We use hydrometric and geochemical data collected at the start of the wet season from three small, steep catchments located in the humid seasonal tropics of central Panama that differ primarily in land cover. We apply a dual source hydrograph separation model between two end-members: new event water precipitation and pre-event water stored in the catchment. We compare the effectiveness of electrical conductivity (EC) and stable water isotopes (δD and δ18O) tracers for identifying precipitation event water in stream runoff using across forested (1.43 km2), mixed land use ‘mosaic’ (1.82 km2) and pasture (0.42 km2) catchments. Hysteretic C/Q loops are analyzed for flowpath interpretation using δD, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Cl−, and SO42−. During a medium-large magnitude event on May 23, 2013, forest and mosaic stream δD, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Na+ exhibited clockwise hysteresis, SO42− exhibited anticlockwise hysteresis, and K+ and Cl− each showed no hysteresis. EC as a surrogate for total dissolved solids agrees acceptably with stable water isotope hydrograph separations during small peak runoff events (<3 mm/h). However, isotope and conductivity tracers strongly disagree during a large runoff event (>10 mm/h) in the mosaic catchment. Early wet-season events indicate lower event water fractions than events farther into the wet season. Despite previous work showing land cover strongly controls storm runoff efficiencies, hydrograph separation and hysteresis analyses only indicate weak event water delivery differences between the paired forest and mosaic catchments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fecal samples were collected from banded mongoose living in protected areas (n = 87, 3 troops) and surrounding villages (n = 92, 3 troops). Human fecal waste was collected from the same environment (n = 46). Isolates were evaluated for susceptibility to 10 antibiotics. Resistant E. coli isolates from mongoose were compared to human isolates using rep-PCR fingerprinting and MLST-PCR. Antimicrobial resistant isolates were identified in 57 % of the mongoose fecal samples tested (range 31–78% among troops). At least one individual mongoose fecal sample demonstrated resistance to each tested antibiotic, and multidrug resistance was highest in the protected areas (40.9%). E. coli isolated from mongoose and human sources in this study demonstrated an extremely high degree of genetic similarity on rep-PCR (AMOVA, F ST = 0.0027, p = 0.18) with a similar pattern identified on MLST-PCR.

Climate change is expected to increase the global burden of diarrheal disease but little is known regarding climate drivers, particularly in Africa. Using health data from Botswana spanning a 30-year period (1974–2003), we evaluated monthly reports of diarrheal disease among patients presenting to Botswana health facilities and compared this to climatic variables. Diarrheal case incidence presents with a bimodal cyclical pattern with peaks in March (ANOVA p < 0.001) and October (ANOVA p < 0.001) in the wet and dry season, respectively. There is a strong positive autocorrelation (p < 0.001) in the number of reported diarrhea cases at the one-month lag level. Climatic variables (rainfall, minimum temperature, and vapor pressure) predicted seasonal diarrheal with a one-month lag in variables (p < 0.001). Diarrheal case incidence was highest in the dry season after accounting for other variables, exhibiting on average a 20% increase over the yearly mean (p < 0.001). Our analysis suggests that forecasted climate change increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation may increase dry season diarrheal disease incidence with hot, dry conditions starting earlier and lasting longer. Diarrheal disease incidence in the wet season is likely to decline.

Little is known regarding the occurrence and epidemiology of L. interrogans in Africa despite the recognized global importance of this zoonotic disease and the threat it poses to public health. In Botswana, banded mongooses (Mungos mungo) live in close proximity to humans across protected and unprotected landscapes and may be a useful sentinel species for assessing the occurrence of zoonotic organisms, such as L. interrogans. We utilized PCR to screen banded mongoose kidneys for leptospiral DNA and identified 41.5% prevalence of renal carriage of L. interrogans (exact binomial 95% CI 27.7–56.7%, n = 41). Renal carriage was also detected in one Selous' mongoose (Paracynictis selousi). This is the first published confirmation of carriage of L. interrogans in either species. This is also the first report of L. interrogans occurrence in northern Botswana and the only report of this organism in a wildlife host in the country. Pathogenic Leptospira are usually transmitted indirectly to humans through soil or water contaminated with infected urine. Other avenues, such as direct contact between humans and wildlife, as well as consumption of mongooses and other wildlife as bushmeat, may pose additional exposure risk and must be considered in public health management of this newly identified zoonotic disease threat. There is a critical need to characterize host species involvement and pathogen transmission dynamics, including human–wildlife interactions that may increase human exposure potential and infection risk.

Lack of resources often prohibits the evaluation of outbreak characteristics and limits progress in managing this important disease syndrome, particularly in Africa. Relying only on existing medical staff and hospital resources, we assess the use of a questionnaire survey tool to identify baseline outbreak characteristics during recurrent diarrheal outbreaks in Chobe, Botswana.
Methods: Using historical surveillance data (2006–2009), the temporal pattern of recurrent diarrheal outbreaks was evaluated among patients <5 years of age presenting to health facilities in Chobe District. Using a questionnaire survey tool, medical staff from selected health facilities assessed patients (all ages) presenting with diarrheal disease during two diarrheal outbreaks (2011–2012). Cluster analysis and classification and regression trees (CART) were used to evaluate patient attributes by outbreak.
Results: We identified a bimodal, annual pattern of acute diarrhea in children <5 years of age across years (Wilcox test, W = 456.5, p = 0.052). Historical outbreak periods appeared to coincide with major hydrological phenomena (rainfall/flood recession). Across health facilities, a significant percent of patients in the prospective study were in the ≥5 age class (44%, n = 515 and 35%, n = 333 in the dry and wet season outbreaks, respectively). Cluster analysis of questionnaire data identified two main branches associated with patient age (<5 and ≥5 years of age). Patients did not cluster by outbreak or village. CART examination identified sex and hospitalization as being most predictive of patients <5 years and household diarrhea in patients ≥5 years. Water shortages and water quality deficiencies were identified in both outbreaks.
Conclusions: Diarrhea is a persistent, seasonally occurring disease in Chobe District, Botswana. Lack of variation in outbreak variables suggests the possibility of environmental drivers influencing outbreak dynamics and the potential importance of human-environmental linkages in this region. Public health strategy should be directed at securing improved water service and correcting water quality deficiencies. Public health education should include increased emphasis on sanitation practices when providing care to household members with diarrhea. While global diarrheal disease surveillance is directed at the under-5 age group, this may not be appropriate in areas of high HIV prevalence such as that found in our study area where a large immune-compromised population may warrant increased surveillance across age groups. The approach used in this study provided the first detailed characterization of diarrheal disease outbreaks in the area, an important starting point for immediate intervention and development of working hypotheses for future disease investigations. While data derived from this approach are necessarily limited, they identify critical information on outbreak characteristics in resource poor settings where data gaps continue and disease incidence is high.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet little is known about how market demand influences natural resources in particular contexts, or the mediating effects of biological or institutional factors. Here, we investigate this problem by examining the Pacific red snapper (Lutjanus peru) fishery around La Paz, Mexico, where medium or “plate‐sized” fish are sold to restaurants at a premium price. If higher demand for plate‐sized fish increases the relative abundance of the smallest (recruit size class) and largest (most fecund) fish, this may be a market mechanism to increase stocks and fishermen's revenues. We tested this hypothesis by estimating the effect of prices on the distribution of catch across size classes using daily records of prices and catch. We linked predictions from this economic choice model to a staged‐based model of the fishery to estimate the effects on the stock and revenues from harvest. We found that the supply of plate‐sized fish increased by 6%, while the supply of large fish decreased by 4% as a result of a 13% price premium for plate‐sized fish. This market‐driven size selection increased revenues (14%) but decreased total fish biomass (−3%). However, when market‐driven size selection was combined with limited institutional constraints, both fish biomass (28%) and fishermen's revenue (22%) increased. These results show that the direction and magnitude of the effects of market demand on biological populations and human behavior can depend on both biological attributes and institutional constraints. Fisheries management may capitalize on these conditional effects by implementing size‐based regulations when economic and institutional incentives will enhance compliance, as in the case we describe here, or by creating compliance enhancing conditions for existing regulations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cryptosporidium was only identified in children less than two years of age (10%, n = 42, 95% CI 3% - 23%), with positive cases occurring during diarrheal outbreak periods. Infections were not identified in adults despite the high level of human immunodeficiency virus infection/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) in the region (n = 117).

Infectious disease is also identified as a primary threat to many carnivores. In wildlife species, population demography and group persistence are strongly influenced by group or population size. This is referred to as the Allee effect, in which a population or group is at an increased risk of extinction when the number or density of individuals falls below some threshold due to ecological and/or genetic factors. However, in social mammalian species, the relationship between the number of individuals and the risk of extinction is complicated because aggregation may enhance pathogen exposure and transmission. Although theoretical studies of the interaction between infectious disease transmission and Allee effects reveal important implications for carnivore management and population extinction risk, information about the interaction has yet to be synthesized. In this paper, we assess life history strategies of medium to large carnivore species (≥2.4 kg) and their influence on population dynamics, with a special focus on infectious disease. While declining population trends are observed in 73 % of all carnivores (both social and solitary species), infectious disease is identified as a significant cause of population decline in 45 % of social carnivores and 3 % of solitary carnivores. Furthermore, where carnivores suffer a combination of rapid population decline and infectious disease, Allee effects may be more likely to impact social as compared to solitary carnivore populations. These potentially additive interactions may strongly influence disease transmission dynamics and population persistence potential. Understanding the mechanisms that can result in Allee effects in endangered carnivore populations and the manner in which infectious disease interfaces at this nexus may define the outcome of developed conservation strategies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied what drives fishers to choose between these two self-governance arrangements in 12 communities in the Gulf of California, Mexico. The communities depend on similar fishing resources, are located in contiguous portions of the coast, fish roughly the same species, have similar socioeconomic characteristics, and sell to similar markets, yet half of the fisheries are organized around co-ops and the other half work through patron-client arrangements. Using participant observation, in-depth interviews of key informants between 1995-2008, and a survey of 55% of the fisheries in the study area, we found that the presence of high transaction costs of commercialization, the desire to acquire fishing licenses, and the existence of traditions of successful collective action among fishing groups within each community strongly influence fishers’ choices regarding membership in fishing co-ops. We also examined the implications of our findings for conservation of fishing resources. Given that the emergence of co-ops was associated with high transaction costs of commercialization, we hypothesize that cooperative strategies are more likely than patron-client strategies to emerge in communities in isolated locations. In an era of globalization, in which the rate of development and urbanization will increase in coastal areas, patron-client strategies are likely to become more prevalent among fisheries, but such self-governance strategies are thought to be less conducive to conservation behaviors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The LBNP was created in 1996; its management plan was completed in 2000, but it was not effectively implemented and enforced until 2003. Between 1998 and 2010, we monitored reef fish populations annually at several reefs inside and outside the LBNP to measure the effects of the park on fish assemblages. We also evaluated reported fisheries landings within the LBNP for the same time series. Our results show that reef fish biomass increased significantly after protection at a small no-take site at LBNP relative to the rest of the park. However, the multi-use part of LBNP where fishing is allowed (99% of its surface) has had no measurable effect on reef fish biomass relative to open access sites outside the park boundaries. Reported fisheries landings have decreased within the park while increasing in nearby unprotected areas. Although the current partial protection management regime has not allowed for reef fish populations to recover despite 15 years as a “protected area,” we conclude that LBNP's regulations and management have maintained the conditions of the ecosystem that existed when the park was established. These results suggest that community livelihoods have been sustained, but a re-evaluation of the multi-use management strategy, particularly the creation of larger no-take zones and better enforcement, is needed to improve the reef fish populations in the park in order to ensure sustainable fisheries far into the future. These recommendations can be applied to all multi-use MPAs in Mexico where ecosystem recovery is not occurring despite maintenance of fish stocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To exemplify this phenomenon, we reviewed MPA efficacy in the Gulf of California, Mexico, where some 23,300 km2 have been decreed as MPAs. With the exception of Cabo Pulmo National Park, MPAs have not met conservation or sustainability goals. We examined MPA budgets and foundations’ investment in the region and found that funding for management is not the limiting factor in MPA efficacy, although funding for enforcement may be deficient. We conclude that MPAs have failed because of insufficient no‐take zones, lack of enforcement, poor governance, and minimal community involvement. We need a new philosophy to implement MPAs to take advantage of the scientific knowledge and monetary investment that have been generated worldwide and ensure that they complement effective fisheries management outside their borders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compound disturbances are phenomena of growing concern which can impact ecosystems in novel ways, altering disturbance intensity, severity, and recovery trajectories. This research focuses on carbon stocks in a compound disturbance environment, with special attention on black carbon (charcoal), a potential source of long-term carbon sequestration. We report on a well-studied compound disturbance event (wind, logging, and severe fire) in a Colorado, USA subalpine forest that was extensively surveyed for impacts on carbon, black carbon, and regeneration. All major pools were considered, including organic and mineral soil (10 cm depth), and contrasted with neighboring undisturbed forests as a reference. The disturbances had an additive effect on carbon loss, with increasing numbers of disturbances resulting in progressively decreasing carbon/black carbon stocks. This resulted from lower substrate availability and higher fire intensity. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference between reference and burned plots in terms of total black carbon. It appears that high-intensity fires do not significantly increase net black carbon in these forests (over the entire fire-return interval), with additional disturbances potentially resulting in a net loss.

Recovery from these perturbations is of prime interest to researchers and land managers. We explore how differing regeneration of the coniferous forest to specific disturbances and a shifting climate are mediated through managerial responses, in terms of both species composition and an important ecosystem service, carbon sequestration in the southern Rocky Mountains, Colorado, USA. 112 sites across a variety of disturbance histories were surveyed for post-fire regeneration; carbon stock growth was then simulated in the US Forest Service Forest Vegetation Simulator under a variety of climate change scenarios for 100 years. Simultaneously, we simulated three managerial responses to the disturbance: no action, planting of local species (resilience-oriented management), and planting of the most climatically suitable species (adaptation-oriented management). These managerial responses simulate varying levels of intervention which attempt to maintain forest properties and associated carbon stocks. Carbon stocks, initially, were more resilient than the coniferous forest system; areas with little coniferous regeneration recovered carbon at a similar pace due to an influx of deciduous seedlings. However, future climate exerts a strong influence on carbon stocks. Both the no-action scenario and the resilience-oriented management scenario transitioned to non-forest by the end of the simulation period, due to climatic changes. Active, adaptation-oriented management, which included establishment of non-local species, maintained forest structure and carbon stocks under most future climate projections, albeit at lower densities. So while this preserves the presence of a forest, it does not preserve the presence of a specific forest. However, for ecosystem services associated with the mere existence of forest cover (e.g., carbon stocks and general forest habitat), this may be sufficient. In a sense, disturbances are opportunities for more climatically-adapted species/communities to establish, although the complexities of assisted migration and novel ecosystems remain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But more than this, these Wests have been historically peripheral regions in Anglophone settler-colonial societies.

A significant influx of terrigenous sediment accompanied by increases in charcoal and the presence of the Polynesian cultigen Colocasia (taro) are indicative of human presence on the island by at least 1060–980 cal. yr BP. Polynesian arrival resulted in the rapid alteration of lowland vegetation illustrated in the pollen record by the removal of the coastal tree Pandanus and the promotion of more economically important trees such as Cocos. The most significant period of burning in the charcoal data overlaps with archaeological evidence for expansion into the island interior and the establishment and growth of more intense agricultural practices from 700 to 500 cal. yr BP. The pollen record also documents the apparent abandonment of the coastal plain near Lake Temae during this phase of inland expansion with the terrestrial landscape returning to an environment similar to that found before colonization. A final phase of environmental transformation commenced with European contact at the end of the 18th century and is marked most clearly in the Lake Temae sequence with the conversion of the system to a freshwater body accompanied by the expansion of the freshwater reed Typha and a level of burning not seen at any time over the previous 1000 years.

Geomorphic and cultural histories for four coastal zones on Mo‘orea are reconstructed based on stratigraphic records, sedimentology, pollen analysis, and radiocarbon determinations from mid- to late Holocene contexts. Prehuman records of the island’s flora and fauna are described utilizing landsnail, insect, and botanical data, providing a palaeo-backdrop for later anthropogenic change. Several environmental processes, including sea level change, island subsidence, and anthropogenic alterations, leading to changes in sedimentary budget have operated on Mo‘orea coastlines from c. 4600 to 200 BP. We document significant transformation of littoral and lowland zones which obscured earlier human activities and created significant changes in vegetation and other biota. Beginning as early as 440 BP (1416–1490 cal. ad), a major phase of sedimentary deposition commenced which can only be attributed to anthropogenic effects. At several sites, between 1.8 and 3.0 m of terrigenous sediments accumulated within a span of two to three centuries due to active slope erosion and deposition on the coastal flats.

Numerous cases exist in which neighboring jurisdictions cooperate to maintain public goods, challenging the expected results, yet theoretical explanations of these cases have not been fully developed. In this paper, we use an agent-based model to explore how underlying micro-behaviors affect the payoffs obtained by two neighboring municipalities in a hypothetical exurban area. Payoffs are measured in terms of regional forested space and of local tax revenue at the end of the agent-based simulations; the municipalities affect these payoffs through their choice of residential zoning policies and the spillover effect between the neighboring jurisdictions. Zoning restrictions influence the conversion of farmland into residential subdivisions of different types, and consequently the location of heterogeneous residential households in the region. Developers and residents respond to the changing landscape characteristics, thus establishing a feedback between early and future land-use patterns. The structure of the simulated payoffs is analyzed using standard game theory. Our analysis shows that a variety of games, in addition to Prisoner's Dilemma, can emerge between the neighboring jurisdictions. Other games encourage coordination or subsidization, offering some explanations for the unexpected observations. The game realized in any given context depends on the initial characteristics of the landscape, the value given to the objectives each township seeks to maximize, and the income distribution of the population.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Furthermore, with the increasing availability of longitudinal land-change data, evidence is needed on the relative performance of these two different methods in situations with differing levels of data abundance. To fill this gap, we generated a pseudo land-change data set using an agent-based model of residential development in a virtual landscape. This agent-based model simulated the decisions of homebuyers in choosing residential locations based on the values of several spatial variables. Pseudo land-change maps, generated by the agent-based model with different weights on these spatial variables, were exposed to statistical analysis under the logistic and survival approaches. We evaluated how well the two approaches could reveal the spatial variables that were used in the agent-based model and compared the performance of the two methods when land-change data were collected under different sampling frequencies. Our results suggest that survival analysis outperforms logistic regression in detecting the variables that were included in agent decisions, largely because it takes into account time-dependent variables. Also, this research suggests that various properties of land-change processes (like amount of developed area and access of agents to information) affect the relative performance of these statistical approaches aimed at uncovering land-change predictor variables.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

This model includes agents representing land buyers and sellers and their respective market-based decision-making behaviors. Our results show that although incorporating key market elements, particularly budget constraints and competitive bidding, in land-use models generally alters projected land-use patterns, their impacts differ significantly depending on the level of detail of market representation. Consistent with theories of land change, our research confirms that budget constraints can considerably reduce the projected quantity of land-use change. The effects of competitive bidding, however, are more complex and depend on buyers’ budgets, their relative preferences for proximity versus open-space amenities, and the size of neighborhoods. Market competition might reduce or increase the quantity of land-use change and the degree of sprawl in the simulated landscapes. Because of the strong effects of market elements on resulting patterns, adequate representation of the structure of markets is important for capturing and characterizing the complexity inherent in coupled human–environment systems.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10; report, not peer reviewed article; no abstract - coding on first paragraph; Still can't find citations on google scholar-

However, the relationship between heterogeneous economic agents and the resultant landscape patterns and socioeconomic dynamics has not been systematically explored. In this paper, we present a stylized agent-based land market model, Land Use in eXurban Environments (LUXE), to study the effects of multidimensional agents’ heterogeneity on the spatial and socioeconomic patterns of urban land use change under various market representations. We examined two sources of agent heterogeneity: budget heterogeneity, which imposes constraints on the affordability of land, and preference heterogeneity, which determines location choice. The effects of the two dimensions of agents’ heterogeneity are systematically explored across different market representations by three experiments. Agents’ heterogeneity exhibits a complex interplay with various forms of market institutions as indicated by macro-measures (landscape metrics, segregation index, and socioeconomic metrics). In general, budget heterogeneity has pronounced effect on socioeconomic results, while preference heterogeneity is highly pertinent to spatial outcomes. The relationship between agent heterogeneity and macro-measures becomes more complex when more land market mechanisms are represented.

This paper is aimed at understanding the relationships between the heterogeneity of the human and natural components of the land system and their interactions, through assessment of residential land-cover characteristics and ownership parcels in these poorly understood exurban lands. New data are presented that describe the distribution of land-cover quantities and their degree of fragmentation in three townships in Southeastern Michigan. Analysis of land-cover data, collected from aerial photographs from 1950–2000 and digitized with a 10 m minimum mapping unit, provide an empirical link between lot-size and vegetation. Results show, among other findings, 1) the quantity and pattern of land-cover types significantly differ with parcel size, 2) the degree of difference was greatest between small parcels and all other sizes and least among large parcels, and 3) of five landscape metrics used to evaluate the quantity and fragmentation of land-cover types in residential parcels, the percent of parcel area provided the strongest delineation of differences in land cover among parcel sizes. Capturing quantities and patterns of land-cover at different sizes of land (parcel) ownership provide new data that can be coupled to ecosystem literature and models to link the outcomes of residential land-cover processes with simple ecosystem functions (e.g. carbon storage, albedo). Understanding how residential land-use and management processes collectively create regional land-cover patterns can provide insight into how residential lands might be managed to mitigate the effects of land change on climate.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

The goal of this article is to address the timing, location, and mechanisms of different types of residential development. Using land-parcel data and aerial imagery taken between 1950 and 2000 for eight townships in southeastern Michigan, we sampled and classified polygons (854 in total) of four residential types. Socioeconomic characteristics were collected from US census data at the township level and assigned to sample polygons based on the township in which they fell. We then applied survival analysis to achieve the above goal. We found that (1) the development rates varied between residential types over time and (2) the evolution of these types can be explained by different factors. Differentiating such residential types and their associated time-variant patterns usefully sheds light on environmental effects of residential land-use expansions in exurban areas.","More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10

Hock, E. Miles and J. G. Cogley",Climate Dynamics,,3,3,232,16Jul20,"A large component of present-day sea-level rise is due to the melt of glaciers other than the ice sheets. Recent projections of their contribution to global sea-level rise for the twenty-first century range between 70 and 180 mm, but bear significant uncertainty due to poor glacier inventory and lack of hypsometric data. Here, we aim to update the projections and improve quantification of their uncertainties by using a recently released global inventory containing outlines of almost every glacier in the world. We model volume change for each glacier in response to transient spatially-differentiated temperature and precipitation projections from 14 global climate models with two emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) prepared for the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The multi-model mean suggests sea-level rise of 155 ± 41 mm (RCP4.5) and 216 ± 44 mm (RCP8.5) over the period 2006–2100, reducing the current global glacier volume by 29 or 41 %. The largest contributors to projected global volume loss are the glaciers in the Canadian and Russian Arctic, Alaska, and glaciers peripheral to the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Although small contributors to global volume loss, glaciers in Central Europe, low-latitude South America, Caucasus, North Asia, and Western Canada and US are projected to lose more than 80 % of their volume by 2100. However, large uncertainties in the projections remain due to the choice of global climate model and emission scenario. With a series of sensitivity tests we quantify additional uncertainties due to the calibration of our model with sparsely observed glacier mass changes. This gives an upper bound for the uncertainty range of ±84 mm sea-level rise by 2100 for each projection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A global estimate of declining water storage capacity in large reservoirs,2013,"Wisser D, S Frolking, S Hagen, MFP Bierkens",Water Resources Research,,2,3,91,16Jul20,"Water storage is an important way to cope with temporal variation in water supply and demand. The storage capacity and the lifetime of water storage reservoirs can be significantly reduced by the inflow of sediments. A global, spatially explicit assessment of reservoir storage loss in conjunction with vulnerability to storage loss has not been done. We estimated the loss in reservoir capacity for a global data set of large reservoirs from 1901 to 2010, using modeled sediment flux data. We use spatially explicit population data sets as a proxy for storage demand and calculate storage capacity for all river basins globally. Simulations suggest that the net reservoir capacity is declining as a result of sedimentation (˜5% compared to the installed capacity). Combined with increasing need for storage, these losses challenge the sustainable management of reservoir operation and water resources management in many regions. River basins that are most vulnerable include those with a strong seasonal flow pattern and high population growth rates such as the major river basins in India and China. Decreasing storage capacity globally suggests that the role of reservoir water storage in offsetting sea-level rise is likely weakening and may be changing sign.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have profound significance to society, and affect regional energy,
climate, and water cycles. Since most suitable lands worldwide
have been cultivated, there is a growing pressure to increase yields
on existing agricultural lands. In tropical and subtropical regions,
multicropping is widely used to increase food production, but
regional-to-global information related to multicropping practices
is poor. The high temporal resolution and moderate spatial resolution of the MODIS sensors provide an ideal source of information for characterizing cropping practices over large areas.
Relative to studies that document agricultural extensification,
however, systematic assessment of agricultural intensification via
multicropping has received relatively little attention. The goal of
this work was to help close this information gap by developing
methods that use multitemporal remote sensing to map multicropping systems in Asia. Image time-series analysis is especially
challenging in this part of the world because atmospheric conditions including clouds and aerosols lead to high frequencies of
missing or low-quality observations, especially during the Asian
Monsoon. The methodology that we developed builds upon the
algorithm used to produce the MODIS Land Cover Dynamics
product (MCD12Q2), but uses an improved methodology optimized for crops. We assessed our results at the aggregate scale
using state, district, and provincial level inventory statistics reporting total cropped and harvested areas, and at the field scale
using survey results for 191 field sites in Bangladesh. While the
algorithm highlighted the dominant continental-scale patterns in
agricultural practices throughout Asia, and produced reasonable

Drought threats would become worse along with climate change, especially in Northern China where the projected climate change scenarios indicated decreases in precipitation in the arid or semi-arid agricultural areas. Pilot experiments have been launched to search alternative farming management practices for adaptation of the climate change in China. Plastic film mulching (FM) has recently been tested at a number of sites in China with encouraging results although no any regional assessment has been done yet. This paper reports how we met the gap by testing a process-based, biogeochemical model, Denitrification-Decomposition or DNDC, against observations and then utilizing the model to upscale the simulations to a large region in China. DNDC was first modified by including a new module, which tracked variations of soil climate under the film mulching conditions. Two new input parameters, i.e., FM-covering fraction and duration, worked in conjunction with daily weather data to define the daily soil temperature and moisture profiles. By varying the FM coverage or duration, we could simulate a variety of FM settings and their impacts on the soil climate. A 3-year dataset of soil climate as well as crop yield measured at a rainfed corn field in Shaanxi Province in Northwestern China were used to serve the model validation tests. The measured and modeled results were in agreement with each other and both indicated that the FM practice substantially improved the soil moisture as well as the crop yield. Sensitivity tests were conducted with the revised DNDC by varying each of four factors, i.e., precipitation, temperature, soil texture and fertilizer application rate, in its range commonly observed in Northern China while keeping other input factors constant. Results from the sensitivity tests indicated that the effectiveness of FM was mainly related to precipitation. Efficiency of FM increased with decrease of precipitation. The FM effectiveness was evaluated at regional scale by linking DNDC to the databases holding spatially differentiated climate, soil and management data for all the 1.17 million ha of rainfed corn fields in the entire province of Shaanxi, across which the annual average precipitation decreased from 940 mm in the south to 390 mm in the north. Results from the regional simulation indicated that (1) corn production increased by 1.79 million tons or 16% with FM applications in the domain of Shaanxi; (2) the FM-induced increases in corn yield mainly occurred in the northern counties of the province where precipitation was lower than 700 mm; and (3) the effectiveness of FM decreased with increase in precipitation from the northern to the southern areas in the domain. The study concluded that film mulching practice could play an important role in elevating rainfed crop yields in the arid or semi-arid regions in China.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accurate and timely information related to global irrigation is therefore needed to manage increasingly scarce water resources and to improve food security in the face of yield gaps, climate change and extreme events such as droughts, floods, and heat waves. Unfortunately, this information is not available for many regions of the world. This study aims to improve characterization of global rain-fed, irrigated and paddy croplands by integrating information from national and sub-national surveys, remote sensing, and gridded climate data sets. To achieve this goal, we used supervised classification of remote sensing, climate, and agricultural inventory data to generate a global map of irrigated, rain-fed, and paddy croplands. We estimate that 314 million hectares (Mha) worldwide were irrigated circa 2005. This includes 66 Mha of irrigated paddy cropland and 249 Mha of irrigated non-paddy cropland. Additionally, we estimate that 1047 Mha of cropland are managed under rain-fed conditions, including 63 Mha of rain-fed paddy cropland and 985 Mha of rain-fed non-paddy cropland. More generally, our results show that global mapping of irrigated, rain-fed, and paddy croplands is possible by combining information from multiple data sources. However, regions with rapidly changing irrigation or complex mixtures of irrigated and non-irrigated crops present significant challenges and require more and better data to support high quality mapping of irrigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model, the current research proposes a Drought Risk Analysis System (DRAS) that allows for the scenario-based analysis of drought-induced yield losses. We assess impacts on corn yields using two case studies, the 2012 U.S.A. drought and the 2000 and 2009 droughts in Liaoning Province, China. The results show that the system is able to perform daily simulations of corn growth and to dynamically evaluate the large-scale grain production in both regions. It is also capable of mapping the up-to-date yield losses on a daily basis, the additional losses under different drought development scenarios, and the yield-based drought return periods at multiple scales of geographic regions. In addition, detailed information about the water-stress process, biomass development, and the uncertainty of drought impacts on crop growth at a specific site can be displayed in the system.

Global land cover maps derived from satellite data provide indispensable information regarding the geographic distribution and areal extent of global croplands. However, land use information, such as cropping intensity (defined here as the number of cropping cycles per year), is not routinely available over large areas because mapping this information from remote sensing is challenging. In this study, we present a simple but efficient algorithm for automated mapping of cropping intensity based on data from NASA’s (NASA: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The proposed algorithm first applies an adaptive Savitzky-Golay filter to smooth Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series derived from MODIS surface reflectance data. It then uses an iterative moving-window methodology to identify cropping cycles from the smoothed EVI time series. Comparison of results from our algorithm with national survey data at both the provincial and prefectural level in China show that the algorithm provides estimates of gross sown area that agree well with inventory data. Accuracy assessment comparing visually interpreted time series with algorithm results for a random sample of agricultural areas in China indicates an overall accuracy of 91.0% for three classes defined based on the number of cycles observed in EVI time series. The algorithm therefore appears to provide a straightforward and efficient method for mapping cropping intensity from MODIS time series data.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Royal Meteorological Soc.,3,3,3,30,22Apr20,"Climate sensitivity in its most basic form is defined as the equilibrium change in global surface temperature that occurs in response to a climate forcing, or externally imposed perturbation of the planetary energy balance. Within this general definition, several specific forms of climate sensitivity exist that differ in terms of the types of climate feedbacks they include. Based on evidence from Earth's history, we suggest here that the relevant form of climate sensitivity in the Anthropocene (e.g. from which to base future greenhouse gas (GHG) stabilization targets) is the Earth system sensitivity including fast feedbacks from changes in water vapour, natural aerosols, clouds and sea ice, slower surface albedo feedbacks from changes in continental ice sheets and vegetation, and climate–GHG feedbacks from changes in natural (land and ocean) carbon sinks. Traditionally, only fast feedbacks have been considered (with the other feedbacks either ignored or treated as forcing), which has led to estimates of the climate sensitivity for doubled CO2 concentrations of about 3°C. The 2×CO2 Earth system sensitivity is higher than this, being ∼4–6°C if the ice sheet/vegetation albedo feedback is included in addition to the fast feedbacks, and higher still if climate–GHG feedbacks are also included. The inclusion of climate–GHG feedbacks due to changes in the natural carbon sinks has the advantage of more directly linking anthropogenic GHG emissions with the ensuing global temperature increase, thus providing a truer indication of the climate sensitivity to human perturbations. The Earth system climate sensitivity is difficult to quantify due to the lack of palaeo‐analogues for the present‐day anthropogenic forcing, and the fact that ice sheet and climate–GHG feedbacks have yet to become globally significant in the Anthropocene. Furthermore, current models are unable to adequately simulate the physics of ice sheet decay and certain aspects of the natural carbon and nitrogen cycles. Obtaining quantitative estimates of the Earth system sensitivity is therefore a high priority for future work.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the precise causal mechanisms behind the observed changes in atmospheric CO2 seasonality remain unclear2,3,4. Here we use production statistics and a carbon accounting model to show that increases in agricultural productivity, which have been largely overlooked in previous investigations, explain as much as a quarter of the observed changes in atmospheric CO2 seasonality. Specifically, Northern Hemisphere extratropical maize, wheat, rice, and soybean production grew by 240 per cent between 1961 and 2008, thereby increasing the amount of net carbon uptake by croplands during the Northern Hemisphere growing season by 0.33 petagrams. Maize alone accounts for two-thirds of this change, owing mostly to agricultural intensification within concentrated production zones in the midwestern United States and northern China. Maize, wheat, rice, and soybeans account for about 68 per cent of extratropical dry biomass production, so it is likely that the total impact of increased agricultural production exceeds the amount quantified here.",More than 10 citations - randomly selected 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While most regions show significant negative runoff trends, some regions exhibit steady increases in runoff (Canadian and Russian Arctic), or increases followed by decreases (Svalbard and Iceland). Annual glacier runoff is dominated by melt in most regions, but rain is a major contributor in the monsoon‐affected regions of Asia and maritime regions such as New Zealand and Iceland.

expanding. Agricultural ecosystems rely on a suite of supporting 
ecosystem services to provide food, fiber and fuel as well as a range of
 accompanying but non-marketed ecosystem services (ES). Ecosystem 
services from agriculture include regulation of water and climate 
systems, aesthetic and cultural services, as well as enhanced supporting
 services (such as soil fertility). Many of these ES are appreciated by 
people, but they lack markets, so they lack the incentives for provision
 that come with prices. For public policy decisions to take them into 
account, non-market valuation techniques are needed, such as travel 
cost, contingent valuation, hedonic valuation, and cost-based or 
factor-income approaches. This article offers an overview of ES from 
agriculture and non-market valuation methods as it introduces the 
articles in this special section on “Ecosystem Services and 
Agriculture.” Understanding how ecological functions generate ES is 
fundamental to management, but so too is understanding how humans 
perceive and value those services. Research is required both to design 
cost-effective incentives to provide ES and to measure which kinds of ES
 could provide the greatest overall welfare benefits to society. 
Agricultural ecosystems offer newly recognized potential to deliver more
 diverse ecosystem services and mitigate the level of past ecosystem 
disservices. This special section of Ecological Economics 
conveys both how these are becoming possible and the challenges to 
science and public policy design of turning that potential into reality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

provision of food, fiber, and fuel. These ecosystem services from 
agriculture, classified as provisioning services by the recent 
Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, depend in turn upon a web of supporting
 and regulating services as inputs to production (e.g., soil 
fertility and pollination). Agriculture also receives ecosystem 
dis-services that reduce productivity or increase production costs (e.g.,
 herbivory and competition for water and nutrients by undesired 
species). The flows of these services and dis-services directly depend 
on how agricultural ecosystems are managed and upon the diversity, 
composition, and functioning of remaining natural ecosystems in the 
landscape. Managing agricultural landscapes to provide sufficient 
supporting and regulating ecosystem services and fewer dis-services will
 require research that is policy-relevant, multidisciplinary and 
collaborative. This paper focuses on how ecosystem services contribute 
to agricultural productivity and how ecosystem dis-services detract from
 it. We first describe the major services and dis-services as well as 
their key mediators. We then explore the importance of scale and 
economic externalities for the management of ecosystem service provision

ecosystem services (ES) is influenced by whether or not the non-marketed
 ES are produced jointly with agricultural products. When marketed 
products and non-marketed ES share some production inputs the production
 relationships between the two may be complementary, competitive or

complementary relationships lead to costless voluntary provision of 
non-marketed ES (typically the case for ES that are supportive of 
provisioning ES for marketed farm products). It is also shown how 
competitive production relationships lead to provision of non-marketed 
ES at lower cost than when non-marketed ES are direct substitutes for 
farm products or are produced outside of agriculture. The paper closes 
by showing how the minimum willingness to accept (WTA) payment for ES 
that are complementary/competitive is less than or equal to the minimum 
WTA for the same ES produced in substitute or independent production

grant.3105229,928388,Soil-carbon response to warming dependent on microbial physiology,2010,Alison et al. ,Nature Geoscience,3,3,3,897,21July20,"Most ecosystem models predict that climate warming will stimulate 
microbial decomposition of soil carbon, producing a positive feedback to
 rising global temperatures1,2. Although field experiments document an initial increase in the loss of CO2
 from soils in response to warming, in line with these predictions, the 
carbon dioxide loss from soils tends to decline to control levels within
 a few years3,4,5.
 This attenuation response could result from changes in microbial 
physiological properties with increasing temperature, such as a decline 
in the fraction of assimilated carbon that is allocated to growth, 
termed carbon-use efficiency6. Here we explore these mechanisms using a microbial-enzyme model to simulate the responses of soil carbon to warming by 5 ∘C.
 We find that declines in microbial biomass and degradative enzymes can 
explain the observed attenuation of soil-carbon emissions in response to
 warming. Specifically, reduced carbon-use efficiency limits the biomass
 of microbial decomposers and mitigates the loss of soil carbon. 
However, microbial adaptation or a change in microbial communities could
 lead to an upward adjustment of the efficiency of carbon use, 
counteracting the decline in microbial biomass and accelerating 
soil-carbon loss. We conclude that the soil-carbon response to climate 
warming depends on the efficiency of soil microbes in using carbon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grant.3105229,928388,Substrate concentration and enzyme allocation can affect rates of microbial decomposition,2011,German et al. ,Ecology,3,3,2,97,21July20,"A large proportion of the world's carbon is stored as soil organic 
matter (SOM). However, the mechanisms regulating the stability of this 
SOM remain unclear. Recent work suggests that SOM may be stabilized by 
mechanisms other than chemical recalcitrance. Here, we show that the 
mineralization rate of starch, a plant polymer commonly found in litter 
and soil, is concentration dependent, such that its decomposition rate 
can be reduced by as much as 50% when composing less than ∼10% of SOM. 
This pattern is largely driven by low activities of starch‐degrading 
enzymes and low inducibility of enzyme production by microbial 
decomposers. The same pattern was not observed for cellulose and 
hemicellulose degradation, possibly because the enzymes targeting these 
substrates are expressed at constitutively high levels. Nevertheless, 
given the heterogeneous distribution of SOM constituents, our results 
suggest a novel low‐concentration constraint on SOM decomposition that 
is independent of chemical recalcitrance. These results may help explain
 the stability of at least some SOM constituents, especially those that 
naturally exist in relatively low concentrations in the soil 
environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grant.3105229,928388,A framework for representing microbial decomposition in coupled climate models,2012,Todd-Brown et al. ,Biogeochemistry,3,3,2,174,21July20,"Accurate prediction of future atmospheric CO2 concentrations is essential for evaluating climate change impacts on ecosystems and human societies. One major source of uncertainty in model predictions is the extent to which global warming will increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations through enhanced microbial decomposition of soil organic carbon. Recent advances in microbial ecology could help reduce this uncertainty, but current global models do not represent direct microbial control over decomposition. Instead, all of the coupled climate models reviewed in the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report assume that decomposition is a first-order decay process, proportional to the size of the soil carbon pool. Here we argue for the development of a new generation of models that link decomposition directly to the size and activity of microbial communities in coupled global models. This process begins with the formulation and validation of fine-scale models that capture fundamental microbial mechanisms without excessive mathematical complexity. These mechanistic models must then be scaled up through an aggregation process and validated at ecosystem to global scales prior to incorporation into global climate models (GCMs). Parameterizing microbial models at the global scale is challenging because some microbial properties such as in situ extracellular enzyme activities are very difficult to measure directly. New parameter fitting procedures may therefore be needed to infer the values of important microbial variables. Validating decomposition models at the global scale is also a challenge, and has not yet been accomplished with the land carbon models embedded in current GCMs. Fortunately new global datasets on soil carbon stocks and fluxes offer promising opportunities to validate both existing land carbon models and new microbial models. If challenges in scaling, parameterization, and validation can be overcome, a new generation of microbially-based decomposition models could substantially improve predictions of carbon–climate feedbacks in the Earth system. Development of new models structures would also reduce any bias due to the assumption of first-order decomposition across all of the models currently referenced in reports of the IPCC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grant.3105229,928388,The Michaelis-Menten kinetics of soil extracellular enzymes in response to temperature: a cross-latitudinal study,2012,German et al. ,Global Change Biology,3,3,3,238,21July20,"Decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM ) is mediated by microbial extracellular hydrolytic enzymes (EHE s). Thus, given the large amount of carbon (C ) stored as SOM , it is imperative to understand how microbial EHE s will respond to global change (and warming in particular) to better predict the links between SOM and the global C cycle. Here, we measured the M ichaelis–M enten kinetics [maximal rate of velocity (V max) and half‐saturation constant (K m )] of five hydrolytic enzymes involved in SOM degradation (cellobiohydrolase, β‐glucosidase, β‐xylosidase, α‐glucosidase, and N‐acetyl‐β‐d ‐glucosaminidase) in five sites spanning a boreal forest to a tropical rainforest. We tested the specific hypothesis that enzymes from higher latitudes would show greater temperature sensitivities than those from lower latitudes. We then used our data to parameterize a mathematical model to test the relative roles of V max and K m  temperature sensitivities in SOM decomposition. We found that both V max and K m  were temperature sensitive, with Q 10 values ranging from 1.53 to 2.27 for V max and 0.90 to 1.57 for K m . The Q 10 values for the K m  of the cellulose‐degrading enzyme β‐glucosidase showed a significant (P = 0.004) negative relationship with mean annual temperature, indicating that enzymes from cooler climates can indeed be more sensitive to temperature. Our model showed that K m  temperature sensitivity can offset SOM losses due to V max temperature sensitivity, but the offset depends on the size of the SOM pool and the magnitude of V max. Overall, our results suggest that there is a local adaptation of microbial EHE kinetics to temperature and that this should be taken into account when making predictions about the responses of C cycling to global change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grant.3105229,928388,A trait-based approach for modeling microbial litter decomposition,2012,Allison,Ecology Letters,3,3,3,259,21July20,"Trait‐based models are an emerging tool in ecology with the potential to link community dynamics, environmental responses and ecosystem processes. These models represent complex communities by defining taxa with trait combinations derived from prior distributions that may be constrained by trade‐offs. Herein I develop a model that links microbial community composition with physiological and enzymatic traits to predict litter decomposition rates. This approach allows for trade‐offs among traits that represent alternative microbial strategies for resource acquisition. The model predicts that optimal strategies depend on the level of enzyme production in the whole community, which determines resource availability and decomposition rates. There is also evidence for facilitation and competition among microbial taxa that co‐occur on decomposing litter. These interactions vary with community investment in extracellular enzyme production and the magnitude of trade‐offs affecting enzyme biochemical traits. The model accounted for 69% of the variation in decomposition rates of 15 Hawaiian litter types and up to 26% of the variation in enzyme activities. By explicitly representing diversity, trait‐based models can predict ecosystem processes based on functional trait distributions in a community. The model developed herein illustrates that traits influencing microbial enzyme production are some of the key controls on litter decomposition rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grant.3105229,928388,Temperature sensitivity of soil enzyme kinetics under N-fertilization in two temperate forests,2012,Stone et al. ,Global Change Biology,3,3,3,180,21July20,"Soil microbes produce extracellular enzymes that degrade carbon (C )‐containing polymers in soil organic matter. Because extracellular enzyme activities may be sensitive to both increased nitrogen (N ) and temperature change, we measured the effect of long‐term N addition and short‐term temperature variation on enzyme kinetics in soils from hardwood forests at B ear B rook, M aine, and F ernow F orest, W est V irginia. We determined the V max and K m parameters for five hydrolytic enzymes: α‐glucosidase, β‐glucosidase, β‐xylosidase, cellobiohydrolase, and N‐ acetyl‐glucosaminidase. Temperature sensitivities of V max and K m were assessed within soil samples subjected to a range of temperatures. We hypothesized that (1) N additions would cause microbial C limitation, leading to higher enzyme V max values and lower K m values; and (2) both V max and K m would increase at higher temperatures. Finally, we tested whether or not temperature sensitivity of enzyme kinetics is mediated by N addition. Nitrogen addition significantly or marginally significantly increased V max values for all enzymes, particularly at F ernow. Nitrogen fertilization led to significantly lower K m values for all enzymes at B ear B rook, but variable K m responses at F ernow F orest. Both V max and K m were temperature sensitive, with Q 10 values ranging from 1.64–2.27 for enzyme V max and 1.04–1.93 for enzyme K m. No enzyme showed a significant interaction between N and temperature sensitivity for V max, and only β‐xylosidase showed a significant interaction between N and temperature sensitivity for K m. Our study is the first to experimentally demonstrate a positive relationship between K m and temperature for soil enzymes. Higher temperature sensitivities for V max relative to K m imply that substrate degradation will increase with temperature. In addition, the V max and K m responses to N indicate greater substrate degradation under N addition. Our results suggest that increasing temperatures and N availability in forests of the northeastern US will lead to increased hydrolytic enzyme activity, despite the positive temperature sensitivity of K m.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grant.3105229,928388,Causes of variation in soil carbon simulations from CMIP5 Earth system models and comparison with observations,2013,Todd-Brown et al. ,Biogeosciences,3,3,3,429,21July20,"Stocks of soil organic carbon represent a large component of the carbon cycle that may participate in climate change feedbacks, particularly on decadal and centennial timescales. For Earth system models (ESMs), the ability to accurately represent the global distribution of existing soil carbon stocks is a prerequisite for accurately predicting future carbon–climate feedbacks. We compared soil carbon simulations from 11 model centers to empirical data from the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) and the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD). Model estimates of global soil carbon stocks ranged from 510 to 3040 Pg C, compared to an estimate of 1260 Pg C (with a 95% confidence interval of 890–1660 Pg C) from the HWSD. Model simulations for the high northern latitudes fell between 60 and 820 Pg C, compared to 500 Pg C (with a 95% confidence interval of 380–620 Pg C) for the NCSCD and 290 Pg C for the HWSD. Global soil carbon varied 5.9 fold across models in response to a 2.6-fold variation in global net primary productivity (NPP) and a 3.6-fold variation in global soil carbon turnover times. Model–data agreement was moderate at the biome level (R2 values ranged from 0.38 to 0.97 with a mean of 0.75); however, the spatial distribution of soil carbon simulated by the ESMs at the 1° scale was not well correlated with the HWSD (Pearson correlation coefficients less than 0.4 and root mean square errors from 9.4 to 20.8 kg C m−2). In northern latitudes where the two data sets overlapped, agreement between the HWSD and the NCSCD was poor (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.33), indicating uncertainty in empirical estimates of soil carbon. We found that a reduced complexity model dependent on NPP and soil temperature explained much of the 1° spatial variation in soil carbon within most ESMs (R2 values between 0.62 and 0.93 for 9 of 11 model centers). However, the same reduced complexity model only explained 10% of the spatial variation in HWSD soil carbon when driven by observations of NPP and temperature, implying that other drivers or processes may be more important in explaining observed soil carbon distributions. The reduced complexity model also showed that differences in simulated soil carbon across ESMs were driven by differences in simulated NPP and the parameterization of soil heterotrophic respiration (inter-model R2 = 0.93), not by structural differences between the models. Overall, our results suggest that despite fair global-scale agreement with observational data and moderate agreement at the biome scale, most ESMs cannot reproduce grid-scale variation in soil carbon and may be missing key processes. Future work should focus on improving the simulation of driving variables for soil carbon stocks and modifying model structures to include additional processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grant.3105229,928388,Global soil carbon predictions are improved by modelling microbial processes,2013,Wieder et al.,Nature Climate Change,3,3,2,553,21July20,"Society relies on Earth system models (ESMs) to project future climate and carbon (C) cycle feedbacks. However, the soil C response to climate change is highly uncertain in these models1,2 and they omit key biogeochemical mechanisms3,4,5. Specifically, the traditional approach in ESMs lacks direct microbial control over soil C dynamics6,7,8. Thus, we tested a new model that explicitly represents microbial mechanisms of soil C cycling on the global scale. Compared with traditional models, the microbial model simulates soil C pools that more closely match contemporary observations. It also projects a much wider range of soil C responses to climate change over the twenty-first century. Global soils accumulate C if microbial growth efficiency declines with warming in the microbial model. If growth efficiency adapts to warming, the microbial model projects large soil C losses. By comparison, traditional models project modest soil C losses with global warming. Microbes also change the soil response to increased C inputs, as might occur with CO2 or nutrient fertilization. In the microbial model, microbes consume these additional inputs; whereas in traditional models, additional inputs lead to C storage. Our results indicate that ESMs should simulate microbial physiology to more accurately project climate change feedbacks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the drivers of microbial community stability, including resistance (insensitivity to disturbance) and resilience (the rate of recovery after disturbance) is important for predicting community response to disturbance. Here, we provide an overview of the concepts of stability that are relevant for microbial communities. First, we highlight insights from ecology that are useful for defining and measuring stability. To determine whether general disturbance responses exist for microbial communities, we next examine representative studies from the literature that investigated community responses to press (long-term) and pulse (short-term) disturbances in a variety of habitats. Then we discuss the biological features of individual microorganisms, of microbial populations, and of microbial communities that may govern overall community stability. We conclude with thoughts about the unique insights that systems perspectives – informed by meta-omics data – may provide about microbial community stability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
