landscape ecology,10,4.992,ecology /biology,"Landscape Ecology is the flagship journal of a well-established and rapidly developing interdisciplinary science that focuses explicitly on the ecological understanding of spatial heterogeneity. Landscape Ecology draws together expertise from both biophysical and socioeconomic sciences to explore basic and applied research questions concerning the ecology, conservation, management, design/planning, and sustainability of landscapes as coupled human-environment systems. Landscape ecology studies are characterized by spatially explicit methods in which spatial attributes and arrangements of landscape elements are directly analyzed and related to ecological processes. All manuscripts must show a keen awareness of the current literature and an immediate relevance to at least one of the following key topics: (1) Flows and redistributions of organisms, materials, and energy in landscape mosaics; (2) Landscape connectivity and fragmentation; (3) Ecosystem services in dynamic landscapes (especially, tradeoffs and synergies); (4) Landscape history and legacy effects; (5) Landscape and climate change interactions (particularly, mitigation and adaptation); (6) Landscape sustainability and resilience (e.g., relationships between ecosystem services and human well-being in changing landscapes); (7) Mechanisms and ecological impacts of land use change; (8) Scaling relations and hierarchical linkages of patterns and processes across landscapes; (9) Innovative methods in landscape analysis and modeling; and (10) Accuracy assessment and uncertainty analysis of landscape studies.",Y,N,Y,Y,

landscape and urban planning,9,5.144,ses,"Landscape and Urban Planning is an international journal aimed at advancing conceptual, scientific, and applied understandings of landscape in order to promote sustainable solutions for landscape change. Landscapes are visible and integrative social-ecological systems with variable spatial and temporal dimensions. They have expressive aesthetic, natural, and cultural qualities that are perceived and valued by people in multiple ways and invite actions resulting in landscape change. Landscapes are increasingly urban in nature and ecologically and culturally sensitive to changes at local through global scales. Multiple disciplines and perspectives are required to understand landscapes and align social and ecological values to ensure the sustainability of landscapes. The journal is based on the premise that landscape science linked to planning and design can provide mutually supportive outcomes for people and nature. Landscape science brings landscape ecology and urban ecology together with other disciplines and cross-disciplinary fields to identify patterns and understand social-ecological processes influencing landscape change. Landscape planning brings landscape architecture, urban and regional planning, landscape and ecological engineering, and other practice-oriented fields to bear in processes for identifying problems and analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating desirable alternatives for landscape change. Landscape design brings plans, designs, management prescriptions, policies and other activities and form-giving products to bear in effecting landscape change. The implementation of landscape planning and design also generates new patterns of evidence and hypotheses for further research, providing an integral link with landscape science and encouraging transdisciplinary collaborations to build robust knowledge and problem solving capacity.",Y,Y,Y,Y,

ecological applications,7,4.378,ecology /biology,"The pages of Ecological Applications are open to research and discussion papers that integrate ecological science and concepts with their application and implications. Of special interest are papers that develop the basic scientific principles on which environmental decision-making should rest, and those that discuss the application of ecological concepts to environmental problem solving, policy, and management. Papers that deal explicitly with policy matters are welcome. Interdisciplinary approaches are encouraged, as are short communications on emerging environmental challenges. Ecological Applications rarely publishes papers focused on the management of a single species or particular habitat unless the case study clearly addresses a topic of wide relevance, broad interest or extraordinary novelty. Case studies accepted in Ecological Applications will almost certainly inform ecological science or management across ecosystems, habitats or taxa, rather than pertaining to a particular species, location or unique setting. Papers that focus on the management of a single species or habitat are better submitted to more specialized journals. Discussions of particular environmental problems, and site- and species-specific research results, will be considered only if they are placed successfully in a more general context. Papers describing new methods or techniques can be published only if they describe truly new and significant advances in methodology that can be broadly applied to the understanding or management of environmental problems. Inevitably, there will be some overlap in subject matter with Ecology; however, papers submitted to Ecological Applications should explicitly discuss the applications or implications of the work with regard to policy, management, or the analysis and solution of major environmental problems. Ecological Applications invites contributions from scientists, policy makers, and managers concerned with the full spectrum of ecological applications. Included within this spectrum are global climate change and biogeochemistry, conservation biology, ecotoxicology and pollution ecology, fishery and wildlife ecology, forestry, agroecosystems, range management, soils, hydrology and groundwater, landscape ecology, and epidemiology.",Y,Y,Y,Y,

Human activity and well-being are dependent on and integrated with the functioning of ecosystems and the services they provide. We aim to understand these basic ecosystem functions using mathematical and conceptual modelling, systems analysis, thermodynamics, computer simulations, and ecological theory, and look to a wide spectrum of applications ranging from basic ecology to human ecology to socio-ecological systems.

environmental management,7,2.715,ses,"Environmental Management publishes research and opinions on use and conservation of natural resources, protection of habitats and control of hazards, spanning the field of environmental management without regard to traditional disciplinary boundaries. Contributions are drawn from biology, botany, chemistry, climatology, ecology, ecological economics, environmental engineering, fisheries, environmental law, forest sciences, geosciences, information science, public affairs, public health, toxicology, zoology, and a variety of other disciplines, often in combinations determined by interdisciplinary study. Contributions are drawn from biology, botany, climatology, ecology, ecological economics, environmental engineering, fisheries, environmental law, management science, forest sciences, geography, geology, information science, law politics, public affairs, zoology. Hence, the journal serves to improve cross-disciplinary communication, and to make ideas and results from any one field available to environmental practitioners from other backgrounds. Submissions need to discuss implications for an international audience before it can be reviewed for Environmental Management. In addition manuscript needs to examine a scientific or management hypothesis in order to be likely to receive a favorable review for the journal. Descriptions of environmental conditions are not appropriate for the journal. As the principal user of the realm of nature, humanity has a major responsibility to ensure that its impacts on the environment are benign rather than catastrophic. Environmental Management facilitates this by disseminating the work of both academic researchers and professionals from outside the universities and colleges, including those in business, government, research establishments, and public interest groups. The aim is to present a wide spectrum of viewpoints and approaches, and to this end the journal consists of four main sections. Forum contains addresses, comments, and opinions about environmental matters. Articles in the Profile section describe and evaluate particular case-histories, events, policies, problems, or organizations and their work. Papers in the Research section present empirical, technical, or other scientific studies and their findings. The section on Environmental Auditing is for articles that cover methods of appraisal and accounting with respect to environmental resources or problems. Generally, the empirical research and auditing lead to a better understanding of environmental problems and usually of their solutions, the debate published in the journal's Forum helps construct better environmental research or policies, and Profile articles may contribute to either aim, or both. Innovative research is encouraged in the sense of both identifying new problems and formulating novel solutions to well known ones. Articles are solicited from all over the world, as the international dimension is considered especially important. Hence it is vital to recognize that many environmental problems are common to a wide variety of nations, while some are either global matters or at least oblivious of national boundaries. It is also vital that approaches, methods, and experience be shared among environmental practitioners in many countries, so that the problems of our ever more interdependent planet may be tackled in a concerted manner. Environmental Management treats mankind as steward of the natural environment: not all resources are to be preserved, but our responsibility to future generations, and to other living species, can only be fulfilled by conserving some resources and using others wisely and sparingly. The complexity of this task demands enlightened research, debate, and policy formulation. Environmental Management seeks articles from professionals at any stage of their careers, from neophytes to recognized authorities. The rate of manuscript rejection is minimized by seeking constructive criticism from referees, so that authors are encouraged to refine and develop their ideas. In the event that important differences of opinion cannot be resolved between authors and referees of readership, the Forum section may be used to present a Comment on an article that has recently been published in the journal, which may be followed by the author's Reply.",Y,Y,Y,Y,
ecological economics,6,4.281,ses,"The journal is concerned with extending and integrating the understanding of the interfaces and interplay between ""nature's household"" (ecosystems) and ""humanity's household"" (the economy). Ecological economics is an interdisciplinary field defined by a set of concrete problems or challenges related to governing economic activity in a way that promotes human well-being, sustainability, and justice. The journal thus emphasizes critical work that draws on and integrates elements of ecological science, economics, and the analysis of values, behaviors, cultural practices, institutional structures, and societal dynamics. The journal is transdisciplinary in spirit and methodologically open, drawing on the insights offered by a variety of intellectual traditions, and appealing to a diverse readership. Specific research areas covered include: valuation of natural resources, sustainable agriculture and development, ecologically integrated technology, integrated ecologic-economic modelling at scales from local to regional to global, implications of thermodynamics for economics and ecology, renewable resource management and conservation, critical assessments of the basic assumptions underlying current economic and ecological paradigms and the implications of alternative assumptions, economic and ecological consequences of genetically engineered organisms, and gene pool inventory and management, alternative principles for valuing natural wealth, integrating natural resources and environmental services into national income and wealth accounts, methods of implementing efficient environmental policies, case studies of economic-ecologic conflict or harmony, etc. New issues in this area are rapidly emerging and will find a ready forum in Ecological Economics.",Y,Y,Y,Y,

environmental modelling and software,5,4.552,multi-disciplinary,"Environmental Modelling & Software publishes contributions, in the form of research articles, reviews and short communications, on recent advances in environmental modelling and/or software. The aim is to improve our capacity to represent, understand, predict or manage the behaviour of environmental systems at all practical scales, and to communicate those improvements to a wide scientific and professional audience. It seeks presentation of: • Generic frameworks, techniques and issues which either integrate a range of disciplines and sectors or apply across a range • Model development, model evaluation, process identification and applications in diverse sectors of the environment (as outlined below) provided they reveal insights and contribute to the store of knowledge. Insights can relate to the generality and limitations of the modelling, methods, the model application and/or the systems modelled. Insights should be ones that are generalizable in some way and are likely to be of interest to those studying other systems and, preferably, other system types. • Development and application of environmental software, information and decision support systems. • Real-world applications of software technologies - particularly state-of-the-art environmental software able to deal with complex requirements, conflicting user perspectives, and/or evolving data structures. Aspects related to software usability, reliability, verification and validation should be backed up with quantitative results as much as possible. Development and maintenance costs, and adoption and penetration of the software in the target user groups should be addressed. Licensing issues and open source access should be clearly specified. • Issues and methods related to the integrated modeling, assessment and management of environmental systems - including relevant policy and institutional analysis, public participation principles and methods, decision making methods, model integration, quality assurance and evaluation of models, data and procedures. Authors must specify clearly the objectives of their models and/or software, and report on the essential steps that were used in their development, normally including the rationale for the type of approach selected and substantial testing and evaluation of it - comparisons with alternative approaches and methods are encouraged. The purpose of this specification, evaluation and reporting is to convey the rigour and credibility of the work and therefore its potential to contribute to knowledge acquisition. To this latter end, authors are expected to briefly review and cite the historical progress made for their problem and clearly show how their work adds value to the literature.

GRL is a Letters journal; limiting manuscript size expedites the review and publication process. GRLalso publishes a limited number of frontier articles, by invitation from Editors. GRL's mission is to disseminate concisely written, high-impact research reports on major scientific advances in AGU disciplines [PDF]. With this goal, the Editorial Board evaluates manuscripts submitted to GRLaccording to the following criteria:

High impact innovative results with broad geophysical implications at the forefront of one or several AGU disciplines.
Results with immediate impact on the research of others and requiring rapid publication.
Instrument or methods manuscript introducing an innovative technique that makes new science advance possible, with immediate applications to AGU disciplines.


GRL has been in publication since 1974. The Editors are adapting GRL to the evolving needs of the Earth science community. GRL Editors are topical: the subject of the paper determines which Editor handles the review and decision process. For more information, please read this Eos editorial.",N,N,N,N,

hydrology and earth system sciences,3,4.936,hydrology,"Hydrology and Earth System Sciences (HESS) is a not-for-profit international two-stage open-access journal for the publication of original research in hydrology. The discussion and peer review of submitted preprints are handled in the open-access discussion forum HESSD. Final papers, upon acceptance, appear in HESS (see interactive review process).

HESS encourages and supports fundamental and applied research that advances the understanding of hydrological systems, their role in providing water for ecosystems and society, and the role of the water cycle in the functioning of the Earth system. A multi-disciplinary approach is encouraged that broadens the hydrological perspective and the advancement of hydrological science through integration with other cognate sciences and cross-fertilization across disciplinary boundaries. HESS, therefore, aims to serve not only the hydrological science community but all earth and life scientists, water engineers, and water managers, who wish to publish original findings on the interactions and feedbacks between the governing processes of the water cycle and processes governing atmospheric circulation and climate, bio-geochemical cycling, dynamics, and resilience of ecosystems and socio-economy.

The scope of HESS encompasses the following:

the role of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the cycling of continental water in all its phases, including dissolved and particulate matter, at all scales, from the micro-scale processes of soil water to the global-scale processes underpinning hydro-climatology;
the study of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the global water resources (solid, liquid, and vapour) and related budgets, in all compartments of the Earth system (atmosphere, oceans, estuaries, rivers, lakes, and land masses), including water stocks, residence times, interfacial fluxes, and the pathways between various compartments;
the study of interactions with human activity of all the processes, budgets, fluxes, and pathways as outlined above, and the options for influencing them in a sustainable manner, particularly in relation to floods, droughts, desertification, land degradation, eutrophication, and other aspects of global change.
The journal publishes research articles, technical notes, opinion papers, book reviews, articles on high-level scientific failures, cutting-edge case studies, brief communications, studies on earth science education and communication, and comments on papers published previously in HESS (see manuscript types). Papers should contribute to the advancement of hydrological modelling, hydrological monitoring and data analysis, process concepts, experimental design and technology, or theoretical foundations.",N,Y,Y,kinda/Y/N,

journal of ecology,3,5.68,ecology /biology,"Journal of Ecology publishes original articles on all aspects of the ecology of plants (including algae), in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We will publish papers concerned solely with cultivated plants and agricultural ecosystems if such articles address important ecological or evolutionary questions. Studies of plant communities, populations or individual species are accepted, as well as studies of the interactions between plants and animals, fungi or bacteria.

We aim to bring important work using any ecological approach (including molecular techniques) to a wide international audience and therefore only publish papers with strong and ecological messages that advance our understanding of ecological principles. The research presented must transcend the limits of case studies. Both experimental and theoretical studies are accepted, as are descriptive or historical accounts, although these must offer insights into issues of general interest to ecologists.",N,N,N,N,
journal of environmental economics and management,3,4.175,ses,"The Journal of Environmental Economics and Management publishes theoretical and empirical papers devoted to specific natural resource and environmental issues. To warrant publication in JEEM papers should address new empirical findings that are of interest to a broader audience, theoretical analyses explaining new phenomena or puzzles, or development of theoretical or empirical methods likely being useful for further research.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
• Analysis of environmental policy
• Further development of valuation techniques and novel applications of valuation techniques to new data sets
• Study of environmental behavior and responses to regulation
• Analyses of exhaustible, renewable and non-renewable, resources and resource policy, notably the economics of fisheries, forestry and fossil fuels
• Analyses of the carbon cycle, accumulating pollutants, such as greenhouse gases
• Environmental problems in developing countries, such as degradation of natural resources and health problems caused by pollution
• Topics of energy economics related to the environment
• Topics of agricultural economics related to the environment

We also welcome interdisciplinary work as far as it addresses environmental or resource economic issues requiring expertise beyond economics. Since JEEM is an economics journal, we do not publish papers that just combine methods of different disciplines but do not address economic issues in the first place.

We usually do not publish papers that replicate standard empirical findings, or apply standard empirical methods to new but similar data sets. We usually do not publish theoretical analyses that are merely minor extensions or variations of known models and results. We do not publish papers that only marginally touch upon natural resource and environmental economics issues.

In our review process, we prescreen all papers and immediately reject some. This includes papers we do not consider a good fit in terms of topic or methodology. This also includes papers that fall short of our high scientific standards. We will not reconsider papers already rejected for publication by JEEM, unless the editor in his or her decision letter explicitly leaves open this possibility.",Y,Y,Y,Y,
